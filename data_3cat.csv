"This is an unfortunate film. One of its biggest problems is its lack of direction. Many of Schroeder's ideas are only half developed, and this lack of decisiveness shows. In a Q&A after the screening, Schroeder said that he did not want his film to be full of ""Hollywood"" clichés; unfortunately this is exactly what happens. As previously mentioned by my fellow critics, the hand-crank technique is used incorrectly and lends the film a music video tone. Add several non sequitur contrivances (e.g. the whole dog pound sequence(s) with its obvious use of stock footage, the way that Cameron receives funding for his film, the sabotage vignette, etc.) and you have a film that is chock full of holes. It also has a problem finding a true voice, which is something a film of this nature hinges on. It never sticks to one subject for long, and when it veers off in another direction, it fails to solidify into anything worthwhile. The one good thing it has going for it is Christopher Plummer. His performance is admirable in the way that he carefully delivers fairly pedantic dialogue. Although many characters were one-dimensional, the cast members did an adequate job. In brief, this is a forgettable film that will wow many people with its ""heart."" However, if you look more closely, you will see that it is shallow and mediocre at best.",Directional Techniques,Visual Effect,
"Sometimes something sounds good, but the bare truth of it all leaks out when you have a crappy director leading the helm. Once again, Sam Raimi proved he is about as incompetent as most PR-video directors, displaying a real lack of vision and insight. Sure, the concept was good, the idea seemed to be there, but it was simply executed with such campiness that the coolness of the film could never overcome the crap. Sometimes having a known director doesn't always work, and in regards to Sam Raimi, it rarely does.",Directional Techniques,,
"A complete cult film in Spain.<br /><br />I think Alex is one of the most original talents in nowadays cinema. And not only in Spain, all over the world.<br /><br />You have to realize what it means to issue such a film, and what a danger you take. How he uses black humour and keeps tension on every scene is incredible. And he has shown that in every one of his films, specially in The perfect crime (a pearl of how to use black humour), 800 bullets and Common Wealth. These are films to take with an open mind, no previous thoughts of what are you going to find. I'm still surprised at each one of his new films.<br /><br />A masterpiece, but not a film for everybody.",Directional Techniques,,
"Some thoughts (for whatever they are worth)- <br /><br /> - The Beach has several Trainspotting-like moments of inspired glee mixed within the overall darker elements of the story (Richard's dark dementia broken up with a little goofy video game bit, for example). It just doesn't seem to work as smoothly and perfectly as Trainspotting, altho The Beach isn't *that* bad a flick.<br /><br /> - One thing another poster mentions is the Beautiful People mold that the Beach inhabitants seem to have been mass produced from. While there is a false sense of glamour and youth in the casting of thin/young/beautiful people, maybe that lends itself as a stark contrast to the very dire circumstances and consequences of their actions. These people are attractive and young and hip, yet they are proven to be ultimately silly and frivolous when faced with the reality of their actions. Well, maybe not - but it makes me feel better to think that, either way ;).<br /><br />",Directional Techniques,,
"I saw that film when i studied films in england, i liked the director's techniques with his subjects.First of all he provokes them in order to get more informations from them, second he manages to become intimate to the viewer with his monologues that take the form of a confession.Many commented that his life is pathetic, maybe so, but it takes courage to expose to the public some very 'personal' moments.Many people might comment about the ethics of documentary, because sometimes he seems to abuse some of his subjects, or even mock them,i have a specific scene in my mind:When he interviews one of the so called patriots,inside a snack bar he pans his camera and while we listen to the 'patriotic credo' we watch another man dressed like a clown.I think this is a film that deserves to be seen because it is a prerequisite for people who enjoy BIG BROTHER and other similar assortments, that victimize their subjects sometimes to the extreme.Compared to those SHERMAN'S MARCH is very innocent much more entertaining though.8/10",Directional Techniques,,
"It is not often that I watch a Bollywood movie in whole, simply because they are usually so embarrassing to watch even alone! I just watch them for music and for the, so far unmatched, choreography! But this film just captured my imagination and kept me arrested till the end. The only other Hindi films that I can speak of with similar admiration are 'Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost' - My Friend from Mumbai, a widely misunderstood and undervalued Indian gem, the Raj Kapoor classic, 'Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behthi Hai' - The Man from the Ganges Confluence - and recent work by maverick and pioneering art house directors of the modern India like Nagesh Kukunoor - 'Iqbal' 2005, Madhur Bhandarkar - 'Page 3' - and Rakesh Omprakash Mehra - 'Rang De Basanti' - The Colour of Sacrifice - 2006.<br /><br />Experimental in almost all departments, but handled by the whole crew and the cast, including the first time director Shaad Ali, with great virtuosity and panache, this is a film that everyone should see, if not for anything but just for the sheer, unforgettable experience of the breathtaking cinematography, the brilliant location selection, masterly costume, art and set design, and above all, the painstakingly executed, digital editing and subtle video effects that puts Hollywood studios to shame. If you are now encouraged to see this movie, watch for the way the camera meaningfully mimics and follows the act as if the viewer is there and sharing the experience of the scene. This filming and editing effect is so subtly handled by both the highly experienced cinematographer and the editor so that the viewer's eyes move with the camera so effortlessly, and after a short while, get accustomed to it. The effect is most prevalent though with songs and choreography, which highlights the composer, A. R. Rahman's quite apparent contribution to the success of this film.<br /><br />The highly acclaimed and surprisingly very young composer A. R. Rahman, easily the Alberto Iglesias of India, has single-handedly pioneered a new kind of world music, mixing the diverse traditional and folk music of India with both western and eastern classical and popular music. The result is a unique and continuously evolving sound that has reverberated around the world to such an extent that it has influenced a wide range of musicians around the world. 'Saathiya' is an excellent example of how his music influences the look, texture and feel of a film, very similar to that of masters like John Williams, Tan Dun and, in particular to the much cherished collaborations between Zbigniew Preisner and the late master Krzysztof Kieslowski. It is hard to get the 9 songs of this film out of your head once you watched the movie, not just because A. R. Rahman is a genius, but because the collaboration between him and the rest of the crew and cast has been just perfect.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the film is much shorter than the usual Bollywood formulaic crap, and, because it has the ability to capture the viewer's attention and hold it to the end, the time just flies while you are having fun. It also is a light-hearted attempt to examine the lives and loves of the youth of the modern and very westernised India, and doesn't bother the viewer too much with too serious and pretentious issues of life and the universe! Watch it and you wouldn't regret it, except for the last scene! Once you have seen 'Saathiya', you should see the original Tamil film , 'AlaiPayuthey' (2000) by writer director Mani Ratnam, a highly creative director to watch for. This is so much admired by Tamil speaking people around the world that it has been posted so many times as low resolution videos on both YouTube and GoogleVideo, so that you can watch it free in full as well as in parts. Despite the origin, the two films are different in atmosphere: Tamil one is quite rural looking while, the Hindi one is quite modern and urban in setting. They are both equally stupendous cinematic creations on their own right despite the differences.<br /><br />BrownPolar Edinburgh April 2008",Directional Techniques,Music,Visual Effect
"Hint to all young producers and directors: just because someone is named ice something does not mean he can carry a movie alone or even act. I don't mind Ice Cube, he is just limited and the angry black guy routine can only carry you so far. This a movie that Fred Olen Ray might have even passed on making, hell maybe even Jim Wynorski. If you must watch this movie, then you might not want to invite any new people over just in case of the whole first impression thing. Overall I would suggest that you would be more entertained by playing charades alone.Jump down. Turn around. Eat a bowl of arsenic.Seriously, I think ice might want to be a little more picky, if possible.",Directional Techniques,,
"First caught this back in 2003, own the DVD now and still impressed by this indie flick. This film has a Mean Streets look and feel to it, and the actors, with the exception of a few weak links, are impressive. Noonan's performance is once to remember, as is Ahmed's directorial debut. The soundtrack, instrumental rock with an edge, is memorable and fits into the desolate scenery of the movie. <br /><br />While the plot is, for the most part, fresh, a few of the main characters (such as the the Hasidic Jew and the Irish mobster) present more engaging character studies than others (the yuppie professionals).<br /><br />Overall, well worth watching for anyone who loves early Keitel, early Scorsese NYC-style films and the witty and interesting dialog of a Whit Stillman.",Directional Techniques,Performance,Music
"I came away from Dead Man's Shoes with a sense of pride; a sense of acknowledgment; a feeling that British film at its lowest budget level and at its grittiest and simplest is very much alive and active. The reaction I had also affected the way I perceive Hollywood a little bit more; it's true that films like Zodiac, Blood Diamond and Apocalypto occupy my top three of 2007 but even some of them and the many others on that list do not match the fondness and recognition that I had for Dead Man's Shoes upon seeing it  the great thing is, this was extensively levelled down in terms of funding but pumped up in terms of quality. Make no mistake, Dead Man's Shoes is very good.<br /><br />I suppose in order to identify this film, I'd have to borrow from America somewhat but that is no shame; this film is 1988's Rain Man meets a hard as nails, gritty revenge film  perhaps something staring James Cagney in his pomp. But it is a revenge film with an air of indifference; the film is often funny, often touching and often heart-warming in its portrayal of inept small time crooks, its nasty flashbacks of bullying and its small inclusion of scenes in which someone with special needs is present and displaying his innocence. While I have only seen the rather underwhelming Once Upon a Time in the Midlands from director Shane Meadows, this isn't so much as a jolt back in the right direction as it is a full blown shove back onto the correct tracks. Meadows directs and unfolds his story in a brilliant manner but in a manner that utilises so many techniques that we the audience flip from happy to sad to anger to disgust and in such a way that we have time to appreciate what we're seeing; feeling and what we think of it all.<br /><br />Paddy Considine plays Richard, a soldier fresh back from, what I can only assume to be, the horrors of Iraq and the Iraq war going on. But where road side bombs and ambushes have been erased, Richard is psychologically stuck with constant explosions going off in his mind  anger, rage, sadness and that lust for revenge when he learns his younger, more simple brother has suffered torment and bullying at the hands of the local drug dealers and young adults who have not matured enough to shake off that 'chav' mentality. Needless to say, he brings home the horrors of Iraq with him in all their bloody infamy in what could be one of the best post-war syndrome studies since Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. The film poster of said film on someone's flat wall perhaps hints at this.<br /><br />But apart from the horror and the tragedy, which does grab you thanks to some flashbacks that I eventually came to fear popping up, everything is revealed in a satisfying and balanced way. Initially, the users of the boy call him over and tap him on the back and invite him in and everything seems very harmless; we even think he is close enough to these people to go out and get some groceries for them if nothing else is on. But whatever we thought is quickly presented to us over and over in a, frankly, quite brilliant piece of directing and pacing as we realise these people are not what they are cracked up to be. Further utilisation of the kid follows; then it gets more serious when drugs and women come into play. Meadows also gets across the element of humour early on in his film; indeed, when you see Herbie (Wolfenden) trundle down the road in his Citroen 2CV with the other guys in the back, you cannot help but smirk at how real this all feels; at how these people are presented as people who live, breath, hang around in apartments and drive obscure cars.<br /><br />But then again, you get the feeling of disturbance. We are not aware of the true extent of things until much later but looking back at the events in the opening hour, the leisurely way in which the gang hang around and talk about nothing in particular considering what they have done is shocking. Meadows also gets across his feeling of foreboding and the sense its all building up to something. Richard's initial work that he carries out on the gang all feels as if it builds up to the big showdown with the final gang member; the one member we will feel a juxtaposition toward since he has a wife and two children. Onto the wrongdoers in question; initially, Herbie is introduced but then we get two of his lackey accomplices living in an apartment; onto a further pair of heavies that come over and finally, Sonny (Stretch) who is the chief antagonist in the bullying of the brother  to him, it goes beyond a joke; it turns into an actual hatred, a hatred of those with special needs with elements of fascism towards those who are not 'normal' starting to creep into the film and its character's psyche.<br /><br />So this is Meadows introducing to us the villains in stages; the targets Richard must deal with if he is to get his revenge  we are systematically told what Richard is up against but there is also that nice little touch of Richard showing up now and again with scare tactics. But with a hero on a mission and a twist that packs a punch Dead Man's Shoes is a big success. When he confronts the family man at the end, Richard himself says that he ""is now the monster"" which tells us that we do not have to root for him any more if we don't want to as he is confronting an apparent innocent but the film is brilliant in its build up, its finale and its attention to detail - great stuff.",Directional Techniques,Plot,
"This is standard movie fare done extremely bad. Big rattlesnakes kill people, and the people who know how dangerous the snakes are can't get anyone to listen. The writers and director try to use every cliché to further their careers. The pity is that this usually works. We're also inundated with the all American look of every man having dark hair and every woman having blonde hair, a neo-Nazi trend used to glorify the Hitler Nazi machine by many movie makers. Again, there are so many rich neo-Nazis who insist upon this being ""classic"", that directors and writers who use this technique go rewarded with bigger and bigger budgets. And don't be fooled. This is a big budget movie. This is expensive work. Don't ever let someone tell you some of these movies are low budget, because they aren't. You couldn't get this much capital to make a movie, unless you are rich yourself. There just isn't anything good about this movie.",Directional Techniques,Others,
"I'd imagine that the main reason that people are paying to watch this is because it stars Alyson Hannigan. Well, she's in it, and she makes the most of a thoroughly unchallenging role, but unless you're a total completist, that shouldn't be enough of a reason to waste even 80 minutes of your life on this appalling waste of talent.<br /><br />What the writer/directors seem to have missed is that if you're going to parody or satirise a scene from a decent movie, you actually have to add something. It's not sufficient to just throw a bunch of stolen scenes together in the hope that the conjunction will generate humour by itself. I honestly could not see one - not ONE - original thought or idea or line in the script or direction. That in itself is something of an achievement. The whole thing plays like it was scripted by teenagers, and not teenagers from the top end of the grade curve.<br /><br />In fact, I have to wonder if this films is deliberately aimed at the lowest common denominator. If so, it missed by several yards to the south.",Directional Techniques,Plot,
"seriously nobody is doing to the Mexican film industry any good by calling this film a classic, because by telling that, it means that this is the better that Mexican directors can do.<br /><br />I tell this because this movie is truly horrible, the acting, the ambiance, even the music it's like a nightmare to the ears. I beg to people from Mexico to be objective, this movie is trash, and it isn't deserve to call it classic, and to say the contrary is an insult for the cinematographic industry of Mexico.<br /><br />One of the dullest film I've seen in all my life. <br /><br />I give 1 out of 10",Music,Performance,

"I had the good fortune of a teacher lending me this in high school. It may be the best documentary ever. Two British film makers traveled to 25 countries recording pieces of music and then fusing them together via laptop, and the results are a stunning fusion of world musics and editing. If that weren't enough there's interviews with artists, scientists, religious scholars, mystics, authors (Kurt Vonnegut and Tom Robbins, actors, activists, prostitutes, people on the street divided into twelve chapters ""Time, Confrontation, Sex, Masks, God, Faith, Blasphemy, Unity, Death, Money, Inspiration, and Happiness.""

"I went to the theater thinking that I would be entertained. Instead, I was disappointed. The music portrayed in this film were above the kid's heads as they could not relate to the outdated tunes. Also, for a scriptwriter to have to use overused dialog really hints that this person has no original thought in their head. Also, the PC themes in there got on my nerves as they do not belong in this country. I could not even feel for the poor Chicken Little as his shallow dad was disappointed in him because he was not the great person he himself once was. It just did not pull me in because that part of the plot was weak. I find this as bad as Robots and Yugioh the Movie. I know that in Hollywood that it's not what you know, it's who you know, but I think that these major film companies need to review their staff of writers and get some REAL talent.

"This is one of those movies that as itself is a gem. For those that have seen it, and ""want to know more"" I HIGHLY recommend getting the book the movie was based upon. The movie is like a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of about 5 chapters of the book!!!<br /><br /> Only complaint was that I think it was a bit TOO vague on the missionary selection process in the beginning of the movie - but did a great job avoiding the ""dogma"" aspect and staying true to the story.<br /><br /> Two thumbs up (even if their my own).",Others,,

No one, not the director, the actors or the crew imposed their message on me ( I saw the Irish pub theatre version of Alexander last week, that movie tattoos it's message on your eyeballs).

"The Forbin Project is a well-done, thought provoking movie. It points out that man's technology could just backfire on him someday. There has to be a limit to how much high-tech ""stuff"" we can come up with, without eventually getting in over our heads. Also makes one wonder if, maybe, there is a better way of doing things that we just don't want to accept.

Pare is adorable and goes through the movie looking like she's not quite sure what's happening to her, or whether she should be enjoying it. Dan Akyroyd is brilliant as an increasingly neurotic businessman who falls for her. The movie unfolds in a series of photoshoots, media clips, sound bites, and interviews.

If the love had been between a man and a woman, you could say this movie has already been made a thousand times (philandering man with slightly psychotic woman....). <br /><br />The action and intrigue are minimal.

Interspered is a sequence in which two women meet in a bar (no dialogue), go to one of their houses and has sex. I have no problem with that, but the sequence seems way too explicit for this.

I was actually one of the Make-up FX artists that help create the ""beast"" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor.<br /><br />What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original make-up for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and re-shoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the re-done creature was no where near as awesome as the original one.<br /><br />For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad re-shoots.

This time around we see Mai Takano and the powers that be go of to look for the answers to the cursed video and to find Reiko and Yoichi only to find that Yoichi has developed Sadako's telekinetic powers and is in-fact becoming the demonic girl. This is the way they should have went in the first pace. 'Ringu 2' blows 'Rasen' out of the water and runs rings around 'Ringu'. T liked the original but found the suspense lacking and the film-making a nit bland, in this film however Hideo Nakata (who also helmed the original) gives the visuals a much needed kick and the atmosphere so much needed zing. The story is a lot more interesting and the acting gives the film a bit of a haunting feel.",Others,,

Tepid, low rent comedy dealing with 4 simpering teen rocker wannabe girls and their dorked out boyfriend.

"Horror fans beware of the Hewitts House Of Horrors. The 2006 Prequel makes its 2003 predecessor look like a breezy Sunday drive. Few movies today contain all the elements of the good old fashioned Late 70's Early 80's slasher genre. TCM - The Beginning gave us that and a whole new platform for other horror movies of today to live up to. Hostel took us to a place of no return TCM-The Beginning guarantee's you wont be coming back. People in the cinema were...erm...nailed to their chairs in what was unfolding on the screen. The ticketgirl was telling all who went to see it 'Good luck.' Never have I been in a cinema whilst watching a horror movie where not one person has a comment, this movie was pure astonishment followed by the occasional boo scare and gargled scream.

This also could have been due to the sound at the venue where we saw it.

"Woody Allen takes two stories, his childhood with his extended family and the heyday of radio, and wraps them together, showing how radio captured the attention of and helped shape America.<br /><br />The story is occasionally a bit disjointed, and while some critics harped on that, I found that it more fit the way nostalgia feel like... bits and pieces of memories held together by common threads. <br /><br />The acting and direction are wonderful. Michael Tucker brings a great comic warmth to the screen, and Julie Kavner and Dianne Wiest are both very, very strong. But the star of this movie is the time in which it is set, and the set design, cinematography and overall mood of the movie are captured wonderfully. I've spoken to people who grew up in New York City during the ""Radio Days"" and they say that Allen captures the era perfectly.<br /><br />I love this movie because Allen doesn't pretend that the past is perfect, but he loves it even with its flaws, and he presents it to us with the love that feels for this time gone by.",Performance,Directional Techniques,Plot

The series takes place in Baltimore(based on a true story), and it is about the everyday happenings in a particular neighborhood and its down and out residents. The Corner takes you into the hellish lives of dope fiends and what they must do to stay high. Of course, this story has been shown before but, the talent of the actors make you feel as though you are watching a true life documentary such as, Investigative Reports(Bill Kurtis).

"With a strong cast including Tony Shalhoub and Maggie Gyllenhaal, we assumed this ""brilliant comedy"" would at least be moderately funny. We were wrong. Not only were the moments of humor rare, but the overwhelming lack of motivation left us scratching our heads. The actors did engage, and each character had enough depth to sustain an interest, but only enough to feel let down at the end. Apparently, the movie was ""about"" 9-11, and if the point was to portray the feeling of pointlessness and futility that many of us felt after the attacks; mission accomplished. At least it didn't meet the 90 minute minimum for Oscar consideration, or we would've had to hear people talk about how great it was.",Performance,,
"Yes, it's on film, it is around 90 minutes like a feature, it's got something that resembles a plot that provides and excuse for the performances, and it seems to participate in a genre marked by ""Pulp Fiction."" But take this for what it is, some very good actors jamming. Barbara Hershey's characterization is superb -- hers and the other performances had me mesmerized (like a frog by a snake?)-- it's that thing that actors do, that transformation that gives a shiver of the uncanny.",Performance,,
"I have to admit this film has a 'Have I met you before' feeling to it. But then most sequels do. Same characters, same personalities leads to some of the stuff being same-ish. Yet I ask you, how many people do you know that drastically change overnight? Not that many. So the same characters having the same reactions and habits to similar situations is not that far fetched. Hill Street Blues characters didn't change that much either yet it stayed entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The acting is of a very high quality and so are some of the action scenes. And there is a twist in the film I didn't see coming. So all in all, not a classic yet highly entertaining, and that is what it was supposed to do.",Performance,Plot,
"I'm sorry for perhaps unfairly skewing the rating on this film by giving it two stars, but I could barely sit through it. I don't think it is necessarily a poorly made film. but it's a film clearly targeted at Asian early- and pre-teens with the inclusion of super-secretive Japanese rock star ""Hyde"" in a prominent, though not leading, role. Every time he appeared on screen I would roll my eyes and groan because he looked like a Keith Partridge wannabe trying to appear tough by smoking cigarettes. He might be a talented musician but he's a terrible actor, at least in this film.<br /><br />The rest of the cast did a credible job. Model, actress, and hair-do, Chiaki Kuriyama is always refreshing on screen. Western audiences may recognize her as Gogo from Quentin Tarentino's Kill Bill Vol 1. She appears to play the piano quite well, vamping on the film's musical theme, ""Last Quarter"", a couple times. I liked the theme a lot, but in the end this modern fairy-tale was just too sugar-coated and precious for my aged sensibility.",Performance,Plot,
"Yikes.<br /><br />First of all, I would like to say that unlike many people here, I apparently am on of maybe 3 people who are capable of reading the BACK OF A BOOK. Yes, kids. When we are the slightest bit vigilant instead of gazing with gaping maws at a television set, we notice things.<br /><br />THIS IS A SERIES THAT SPAWNED A BOOK, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. SERIES FIRST, BOOK SECOND. Get it? Now that that is out of the way... I was one who picked up the book first and then went to the series. I had great interest in tracking it down to compare the series with my imagination. My boyfriend, in his kindness, found it for me and bought it as a gift.<br /><br />With all respect to his kind endeavor, I almost wish he hadn't spent the money.<br /><br />After crafting characters in your imagination from reading a book, it is expected that your perceptions will not measure up with a visual/audio representation of the same. I was shocked to find Richard to be a clumsy fool who is painful to watch, let alone sympathize with. Door becomes a character with little to no mystique about her, far removed from my perceptions of a charming and oddly elegant ragamuffin. Similarly, the bravado of Hunter is turned into that of a psychotic cave woman, with the brilliantly deadly Croup and Vandemaar far less like their ""wolfy and foxy"" counterparts that I had dreamt up which amazed and terrified me.<br /><br />That aside, I do realize that there is little sense in comparing the latter to the former and expecting to have something made *BEFORE* the previous medium I had read be considered the thing to be changed.<br /><br />It is for this reason that I beg people who have seen the series to not give up on Gaiman. His novelization of this series is far superior in terms of storytelling, character development, presentation, etc. I do have to say that it was a darn shame to have all of the beautiful characters I had imagined and the intricate world that captivated me so reduced to this. PLEASE read the book if you want a better presentation to a wonderful story. This truly would be unwatchable if it weren't for Gaiman's inventive story and charming dialogue, even if it is utterly butchered by mediocre acting and very poor budgeted sets.<br /><br />All in all, please read the story if you want a great adventure and steer clear of this series unless you are unshakably a Gaiman fan.<br /><br />And I DO mean unshakable.<br /><br />However, if you did get past all of the above problems and loved it still, I highly recommend running headlong from you television sets and diving in to American Gods, The Sandman, or any of the other fine written works of Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />In short, please, just save yourself the time and money and read a book.",Performance,Visual Effect,
"First off, I just have to ask if anyone knows if this was intended to be a comedy? I am a fan of the works of Dario Argento. In my opinion he is a master of the craft who can superbly wrap the viewer around his finger. With The Phantom Of The Opera, however, I feel that he may have bitten off more than he could chew. The whole thing seems ill advised from the start. Its been some time since I read the book by Gaston LeRoux, but I do not recall the Phantom having a perfectly fine face. Nor do I recall that he was raised by rats or a rat catcher being a main character who drove around in the labyrinth under the opera house on a steam powered rat vacuum. Truly that was one of the most bizarre elements added to the tale. There were murders in the original novel, that I do recall, but I do not recall them being borderline slasher kills. To be fair, the slasher slant is not a new one. Robert Englund starred in a so-so slasher take on the novel in the late 80s. It just seemed like the film was trying to constantly outdo every other take on the tale and failed on every level. Much of the acting is awful to say the least, and some poor dubbing doesn't help matters any. In all honesty, the only actor with any real power in the film is Asia Argento. She gives a very good performance as Christine. Julian Sands is normally a fine actor but here he seems to be overacting much like the rest of the cast. Avoid this one and stick with the old B&W version. Its far better.",Performance,,
"This was the kind of movie....that I thought was amusing and sweet for a low budget flick! It had some mistakes...but 'so what' all movies do...even blockbusters!

Singing was 'shaky' but I really did enjoy the rap numbers...especially the one's by Mysterious and Tangerine.....The white, black rap was kind of funny, but could have been just a bit better.....But it was worth it just watching Tangy (Boobie Monroe).

"This makes B movies look like blockbusters. It's one of those stupid college prank movies that is just bad. Laughably bad would mean at least there are laughs.<br /><br />The horrific acting, incredibly inane script is bad enough. But the over the top characters are so lame. I'm so glad I only caught a portion of this movie. I watched it because I liked Dean Cameron in an old TV show and was curious to see what he had done since then. What a disaster. Unless you are 7 years old with a very low IQ, you will not believe what a total car wreck this movie is and will wonder how it was ever funded.<br /><br />This movie breeds a whole new low in the intelligence scale. Cameron unfortunately is smarmy and no matter how fearful a situation is, he is the same wisecracking jokester because we all know that he isn't ever going to be hurt so he can be the obnoxious cavalier buffoon.

"after seeing a few .gifs, i decided that renting The Stuff would be worth it. now, the movie itself is pretty crummy - strange bursts of acting from some familiar (in usually better movies) actors. on to the real reason i rented this, the special effects. there's a small part where a puppet of a dog is spasming as it belching up The Stuff. that part reminded me a bit of The Thing (which has amazing SFX, to this day). also, there is a tiny snippet of gore where two of the protagonists burst open some goon's heads (pretty fake looking, but kind of entertaining). the stuff itself is animated with computers, i think, and is enjoyable to watch it slide around. lastly, and probably the best of the SFX moments, is when one of the main characters starts twisting about and pukes up the evil ooze before exploding. if you can stomach some weak performances, this is worth a cheap (cost me 50 cents) rental to watch the SFX. otherwise, see the much superior ""melting"" movie Street Trash. I ordered another melting movie called ""Body Melt"", which will probably turn out better than this. overall rating: four out of ten possible stars.",Performance,Visual Effect,

And the concert had to be so grand for the sake of Sir Andrew. I adore the moment when the entire cast sings `Happy birthday' to him. A charming scene! Furthermore, ALW presented his new masterpiece The Heart Is Slow to Learn sang beautifully by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, and then a young star Lottie Mayor performed Whistle Down the Wind in the most engaging manner with Sir Andrew himself at the piano. My favourite Jellicle Ball (Cats) was used as the brilliant conclusion of the concert. It's a show to enjoy again and again and again!",Performance,,

The original with Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore was a much better film. I realy think that films with Liz Hurley in should have a big warning on them so I don't watch them by accident.

They want it so much to make these gangsters be like their Italian-American counterparts and the end result is completely ridiculous.

"An amiable and amusing mockumentary, 18 FINGERS OF DEATH stands roughly in the same relation to Kung Fu movies as SPINAL TAP does to rock music. Low rent action star Buford Lee (James Lew, familiar from supporting roles BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS and TRAFFIC), sporting a certifiable Bruce Lee accent, is trying to get his new martial arts film 18 FINGERS.. off the ground. His travails are recorded by first time documentary maker, ever enthusiastic fan Ronald Mack (Maurice Patten). Along the way there are gentle parodies of martial arts heroes 'Stephen Seafood' 'Chuck Snorris' and most memorably, 'Antonio Bandana' etc, extracts from Buford's previous releases and scenes of the rehearsal and shooting of his latest one. Much of the acting on offer here is fine and the cinematography is excellent too (my DVD box claims the ratio is 4:3 but it is actually 1.85:1). The relationship between Lee and Mack is what gives the film its gravity  one especially relishes the scene when the star proudly shows him his collection of treasured Kung Fu memorabilia, including 'the actual socks worn by Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon' (sadly unwashed) - and the obvious affection shown the genre by the principals shines through constantly. It's a shame that the film somewhat runs out of steam at the end, especially once Mack has left the story. Occasionally too, jokes could have been sharper, a fact especially true of the late, extended fight scene between Bandana and Lee which plays out the old farting routine for too long, its introduction a sure sign that invention is flagging. One misses the insane surreality which appeared in KUNG POW its absence due, perhaps wisely, to 18 FINGERS' recognition that such elements would appear somewhat jarring in the context of a supposed factual format. But the buoyant Patten is a real find, one of the best things in the picture in fact, clearly a talent to watch, Lew's more restrained performance allowing his co star his head. On my copy some of the action scenes seemed a bit dark, but this is not too much of a distraction. All in all, this is worth watching, with no real slow patches, although as one might expect martial arts fans  and lovers of straight-to-video chock socky - will laugh the most.",Performance,Visual Effect,Directional Techniques

The ending of the film includes a great battle scene, and i love the film that much that the tape is worn out. My favourite film of all time and made me a solid fan of the series. This was the pilot episode, and its a shame that Jan-Michael Vincent ended up the way he did. It would have been nice to see the Hawke brothers work together in the chopper, instead of how the 4th series turned out (a load of rubbish and a slap in the face to hardcore fans of the show).

"I just saw this on Turner Classic Movies (TCM), and from now on, Norma Shearer is the face I will put on Marie Antoinette. Such great acting from such a beautiful woman who truly embodied the role.<br /><br />These days, it seems that every big movie has to have some cursing, nudity, sexual references of every kind or strong violence, but this old film is better than many of the latest, and it's in black and white, no nudity, or anything else that we have come to expect from movies.<br /><br />For instance, if this film were made today, we would expect to see the beheading. This film doesn't show it, so it doesn't leave you with the shock or awe of seeing a beheading, but it does leave the cruelty of the situation which is much more enduring and meaningful to the tragedy.<br /><br />Whether this is historically accurate wasn't a concern with me since all I really remembered from school was that she was beheaded, so this shouldn't be a spoiler. But the story was engrossing and very enjoyable regardless of whether it was historically accurate. Indeed, if anything, it may inspire personal research as to what Marie Antoinette was really like.<br /><br />Full stars because this film truly is an excellent film and should be watched. I'm really liking some of these old great movies for some of the reasons already stated. Take away color, special effects, gratuitous violence and nudity, and you're pretty much left with having to make a movie with great photography, acting, and writing. Take the cream of that crop, and you're pretty much guaranteed an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Forgive me, I just recently became willing to pay for cable TV, and I'm really starting to dig these classics that I would probably never have seen otherwise.

The Venusians were about as scary as laundry flapping in the breeze.<br /><br />I watched this movie on my ~Sci-fi Classics 100 Movie Pack~- a great way to spend $20 bucks, by the way.

I don't know how accurate the film was, as I don't keep up with celebrity gossip and haven't read any of the biographies on Prince Charles or the Charles/Diana/Camilla situation, but I enjoyed this film. I look forward to seeing more films featuring actor Lawrence Fox. I recognized him as the actor who portrayed a German pilot in the BBC series ""Island at War."" He really humanizes Prince Charles in this film, I think overall it is a very flattering portrayal, although I don't really like how he and Camilla took advantage of Diana's innocence and youth, they really ruined her life.

The plan is to find her a husband, a Mr. Wonderful, so he won't have to pay alimony any more, but when she finds one, he discovers he wants her back, says the video jacket. Matt Dillon puts in a very convincing performance as a working man, ""fix-it"" kind of guy who doesn't understand his more intellectual ex-wife; Annabella Sciorra is wonderful as his ex-wife, going to college and working with plants; William Hurt puts in a great performance as her married professor and lover; and Vincent D'Onofrio is excellent as the pharmacist who remembers her from high school.

Player 5150 is a gem of a film. It is a nice break from all those splashy special effects used nowadays to entertain audiences. This was a good character driven story about a degenerate gambler that pushes it too far. Anyone that has been involved with the rush of sports betting can relate to the plot and characters. Ethan Embry delivers a stand out performance lead role JOEY. His delivery combined with facial expressions made him seem like a true everyman caught up in a bad situation. I felt for the guy even though it was only a film. Kathleen Roberston was amazing. I only knew her from her days on Beverly Hills 90210.<br /><br />Bob Sapp makes a worthy cameo. Despite not being an actor he wasn't terrific or terrible. Overall I was entertained by Player 5150.

I know there has to be something, in any level of adult fare, for every sexual taste, but I would have preferred less lesbianism and more hetero-action. Among other things, I applaud Ms.Allen for the gutsy decision to accept this role, in view of the fact her acting talent and beauty should get her about anything she wants in film.

"Like another user I found this movie at a ""dollar store"" and decided to take a chance on it. I believe the stories that this was pulled from circulation simply because I had never heard of it before. Where have they been hiding this movie? <br /><br />I can believe those stories for another reason. It has an eerie feel to it ... and seemed oddly prophetic: Imagine, an attempt to kill a President from a sniper position in a window above and behind, using a military-style weapon, by a former soldier. If Oswald truly watched this movie ... one would have to wonder how HE felt about the movie. I mean, I wasn't aware of that bit of trivia until I watched the movie and THEN checked out IMDb. While watching it I could not help but draw comparisons. Brrrrrrrr. It seems plausible that Sinatra might have had similar feelings.<br /><br />Sure, this is not the best movie ever made but it is a good solid 1950s movie, with a good performance by Sinatra. Yes, it is corny, but given the timeframe, that is to be expected. To be honest, I am tired of special effects and enjoy movies with an actual story and actual acting.

The dual role played by the unbearably unwatchable and quasi-intense Fiennes (proving acting is not a genetic trait), is excruciating bizarre and Gretchen Mol must have wondered after and hour of plodding dialog how she was not supposed to realize that the new mysterious Hispanic guy was her old flame. It's really bad. The only faintly amusing scene is where Ray Liotta acts so frustratedly since the rest of the cast were so - duh - lifeless. When he later says he is going to kill everyone I really thought it would be Fiennes, Mol, then the director, the screenplay writer (same guy, maybe), the cameraman before turning it on himself. Even the ending is so cheesy I felt the audience should have been on life-support. I kid you not. Terrible. Not for ""connoisseurs of the simply awful"", it's not that interesting. I'm sorry I couldn't give it less than zero. Some people gave it a ten. How? They misread the instructions? They are in the film, maybe? Liotta would give it a zero, I'm sure.

"The number of goofs in this movie almost had me laughing.<br /><br />The fantastic doomsday device is ""Tesla's Death Ray."" In this movie, the device consists of some electrical apparatus and a set of headphones, which is crammed into a wooden box that can fit under an airline seat. After Tesla journeyed to a remote part of Siberia in 1908, to test his death ray, he found its destructive potential is so great that Tesla never spoke of it again, so say the characters in this movie.<br /><br />Despite a wealth of information available about Tesla's inventions and his notes, the makers of this movie plod onward with this fantastic device and numerous goofs. A geiger counter is used to track down Tesla's electrical device, earphones are used to control and direct its destructive force, Tesla installed a self-destruct mechanism but hid the device in a cave, and Tesla tested the device on ""the 13th day of June in the year of our Lord, 1908.""<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Tunguska explosion occurred on June 30th, 1908, (not the 13th). Anyone expecting any facts about Tesla, his death ray, or the Tunguska explosion should look elsewhere. This hodge-podge doomsday device is the only excuse for what follows, and with the exception of ""Bongo the Bear,"" I must rate this movie a pointless zero, (no stars).<br /><br />",Plot,,
"I caught this on French TV about 2 months ago, with high hopes because it features Jean Reno, but I was very disappointed. It's a romantic comedy so by definition you expect to forgive some contrived story-telling, but in return you expect some kind of narrative sleight of hand to distract you from the mechanics. Unlike fast-moving classic chick-flick When Harry Met Sally, this film is all talk and no action and it moves at a snail's pace, forcing you to deliberate over every drawn-out narrative twist.<br /><br />Jean Reno plays an uptight, very private celebrity chef who is obsessively clean. Co-star Juliette Binoche is a Bohemian middle aged beautician who lives behind a mask of makeup, constantly calling her mother and trapped in a destructive relationship. The film asks us to believe that because he loans her his phone and tries to pass on a message, then meets her unpleasant boyfriend, he will offer to share his hotel room when their flights are cancelled due to a strike and that they will both begin to open up emotionally.<br /><br />The performances are so subtle that they barely register, and the inevitability of the rom-com structure makes waiting through the minutiae of their developing relationship a challenge rather than a joy.",Plot,Performance,
"Though I find most of US reality TV-series quite boring I must admit that's the one I really love. Mainly because it's so global, mixture of different cultures and traditions. You can see difference between developing countries and developed countries and so on. It's fun to watch teams pushing themselves over the top with some rather weird quests and having an arguments over nothing. The tasks are usually tied with the country they're competing and that's very cool too.<br /><br />The series budget is huge. They were racing in Estonia (Where I live :) in summer and my friend took part of it too and revealed how the show was being made. It's just amazing, local TV stations were paid for not to show or write anything about the series. Every smaller detail is checked and must complete the checklist of 5 pages of contract. The story also is usually confirmed on the very last minute after searching for optimal tasks and routes by the producers. And that is what makes the show special.<br /><br />Only thing I don't like in the series is the fact that some conflicts are shown too prolixly. For example when one of those black sisters called Luke ""bitch"" in the last season.<br /><br />But otherwise it's brilliant show and I think everybody find it exciting when one bothers to watch it.",Plot,,
"Wow. That is pretty much all that I can say. For you bad movie lovers out there, this one is possibly the grand-daddy of them all (and yes I have seen Manos the Hands of Fate). Trust me on this one--unless you saw Blair Witch and you know how a movie can actually make you sick, don't rent this film. To be honest with you, I rented this because of the cover: a giant headed, freakishly odd looking alien holding hands with two African kids--that's funny. However, I was soon to learn that the only thing funny about this movie was that a four year old with a hand-held could have done a better job. I don't want to summarize the plot for you, because I'm still not sure what that was. Something about Nukie (an alien) trying to save his brother alien from the evil United States Commodore-64 controlled testing facility. In between can be found talking animals in shorts, stock footage stolen from National Geographic, and all in all, the worst movie I have ever seen. This movie actually made my friend physically sick to his stomach. Frankly, I am sickened to say that man could possibly create such worthless drivel.<br /><br />Let me put it this way--See this movie just so you know that in no possible way has your life been even close to a failure; unless you were involved in the making of this film (if you can actually call it a film). Because no matter what you've done in your life, it could never reach the low that this movie has achieved.",Plot,,
"This low-key film brings to life the struggle between the army and rebellious peasants in 1970's Mexico through the words and actions of an unlikely hero, the elderly, diminutive Don Plutarco Hidalgo (played by Angel Tavira, a real-life violinist).<br /><br />Plutarco, owner of the eponymous violin, is seen early on in the film playing his instrument to earn a living and to give expression to the feelings of himself and his companions. In the city he scratches a living from busking with the assistance of his son and grandson, but later his instrument offers consolation and catharsis to his fellow-villagers when they are uprooted from their homes by brutal Mexican soldiers in search of rebels harboured in the rural community.<br /><br />When Plutarco has his violin confiscated by the local military commander and is forced to play for the latter's edification this eloquently communicates the way in which simple rural folk had their voices suppressed and their livelihoods taken away by army cruelty. Whilst Plutarco cunningly works to aid the rebels against the military there are shocking scenes of military brutality, which presage a bleak ending for the protagonists; by the end of this film I was among several members of the audience biting their nails with concern.<br /><br />This is quite a short film (a little over an hour and a half) but its characters are powerfully portrayed and enlivened by well-written and sometimes witty dialogue. A special mention must be made for the black-and-white cinematography: the film looks superb.",Plot,Visual Effect,
"Paolini's novel should have been left alone. It was unnecessarily tampered with to make it into a lack-luster movie losing all magic, motivation, and meaning. The writers, director, and producers missed a real opportunity to make this into a great trilogy experience...perhaps they should have read the books first because they were much better than this. Get better actors and get a better director and you will have something. My advice...produce the movie again . We will forget the first attempt and bring back Rachel Weisz who made the dragon the best part of the film and it will be a better film. If you do that, it will succeed.",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"Well, I fully agree on the script being absolute crap. Who ever wrote that must have had an IQ of less than 2. The acting was also not impressive but whoever expected it to be was out of their mind. This is not the kind of thing where you would expect Academy performances, so who cares about that? <br /><br />I honestly believe that whoever compared this film to Twin Peaks was definitely high on crack or crank or something. Whatever it is, please give me some. I cannot fathom how there could be any comparison to something as brilliant as twin peaks to this. It's like comparing A Clockwork Orange to Napoleon Dynamite. Anyhow, I thought that it could be worse.... Than again, I was anticipating the worst. I did like the artsy bits like the beginning and the back story.<br /><br />P.S.

"I tuned into this on late night TV a couple nights ago, without having a clue about what it was. I thought it might've been one of those documentaries about a family, or a really low budget soap opera, but I knew it was different once...well, once the aliens appeared. After a kind of average beginning, this movie only gets better. The performances are realistic, the action and thrills are intense, and, even though the budget is obviously very small, the director does a great job of keeping the aliens out of view. Along with all this, the story keeps twisting and turning, and although it's a movie about aliens abducting people, it could make the biggest skeptic believe some of this stuff. It's one of those movies that, after it ends, leaves you kinda (or very) shaken up. And it's not like I get freaked out easily by movies or don't watch enough of them--I watched The Shining the night before, and Alien Abduction at least equals it in suspense and intensity. Apart from being the most clichéd basic idea EVER (average American family is abducted by little green men), this is a surprisingly great movie. Low budget doesn't mean low quality.",Plot,Performance,
"A man's relentless drive toward self-destruction is the tenor plot in this film, but the surrounding study of human nature, and of what can be the ultimate values in life fill out the canvas. Squarcio, the hero, has through good fortune escaped detection long enough to establish a comfortable life for his family and loving wife. Other fishermen, who have reason enough to detest him, consistently show him compassion - their basic good natures prevailing. Squarcio, though, like a ""Sturm und Drang"" character, relentlessly pursues a path his logic - and wife and children - tell him he should abandon. He is offered other choices; he sees other charismatic characters uselessly die - yet his actions are emotionally driven.<br /><br />At mid-film, the local coast guard commander chooses to retire, to quit service before having to witness the death or imprisonment of his childhood friend. I, the viewer, felt likewise - very much like abandoning the theater before the inevitable. Yet I stayed on, hoping for some early hint of a happy end to come.<br /><br />But for me, the most memorable moments in this film were certain sea scenes set to challenge the most beautiful and intriguing of any painting of the old Venetian school - sepia sails, emerald seas, white and green (?) hulls, and old fortresses in the background - all looking a bit unreal, like a child's playthings, almost too perfect, too harmonic. Squarcio, of course, wasn't part of such scenes - he was off on his own, individualist but misguided path.",Plot,Visual Effect,
"High Expectations-Lower than low results. Just another cute-family-movie that makes me wanna yell 'LAST REEL, PLEAAAAAAAASE' every couple of minutes.<br /><br />I just don't get how people like Whoopi and Loretta could read, enjoy and accept such a script suffering of terminal cuteness. What is it all about? That african american women are born to suffer, bring babies to the world, clean up the mess their husband is doing and go to church and pray god, sing gospel (of course, every african american woman sings gospel). That african american men are born to be pathetic losers waiting for wellfare, prison or being unfaithful to their wives, being alcoholic,etc,etc... wait... is this being human? nah. The script doesn't know where to go so it makes every character having something bad to confess or to suffer from. Something's got to happen to them in order to keep the audience awake. Which I hardly did here.<br /><br />So Loretta knows how to scream. So Whoopi can be pouty. LL Cool just looks at everyone, his face screaming ""look, I can act like an alcoholic"" but it still doesn't work. Toni Braxton is, well, Toni Braxton. And Jada is, hum,well, like what she's been doing these past few years...her best part being Scream 2, I guess. These characters are just one-dimensonial and caricatures of what human beings really are. And this happy end where everyone forgives everyone and all is good in the end, right? Yuck. I remember a time where a director such as Charles Burnett was really directing and having a point of view.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong doing a family movie but a movie that looks like a tv movie should stay where it belongs : on tv. No swearing (that's BAD), no sex (that's WORSE), God is good, family is good, going to church is good, not going is bad : the character that dies wasn't going and keeping poor Whoopi out of it! No wonder he's considered so mean by almost everyone! That is, I guess, the whole point of the movie.<br /><br />Being a believer -which I'm not- is probably a great thing. To give a moralizing point of view is sickening. To achieve such a low quality in movie making is beyond redemption. Go rent KILLER OF SHEEP or JESUS OF MONTREAL.<br /><br />This movie is a just another turkey stuffed with so many clichés that the hoven is about to explode before Thanksgiving.<br /><br />Superwonderscope says 1",Plot,Others,
"Narrated by Eric Stoltz, who plays a man who has lived his entire life in a small town named Homer. He tells three tales of homophobia and how it is has effected the lives of several Homer citizens. Brittany Murphy is a girl in the navy who is dishonorably discharged after she experiments with another girl. When she returns home, her discharge papers are required for employment and the entire town knows that she's a ""queer."" Her mother (Margot Kidder) throws her out of the house and she's on her own,left to battle the cruel Homer residents. Jonathan Taylor Thomas stars in the ""1974"" segment as a homosexual teenager who is taunted by his swimteam and classmates. He seeks guidance from his teacher, played by Steven Weber, whom he suspects is gay. The teacher, however, fears losing his chance at becoming school principle and allows the tormenting to continue. In the final segment, a gay couple tries to marry in Homer with a negative community reaction.<br /><br />""Common Ground"" is a nice film about acceptance and tolerance, but it could have definitely done without the scene where Thomas' character is raped orally by a cruel team member. The scene should have been integral to the development of the film, but it just happens, no one speaks of it and the characters forget it ever happened (bad editing, or was it meant that way?) I don't know. That part confused me. But, overall, it was a decent movie, especially for Showtime. 7/10",Plot,,

"""I Love to Singa"" is probably the funniest cartoon I've ever seen. It's a spoof of The Jazz Singer, and although seeing that film helps make the cartoon even funnier, you can still appreciate the cartoon without seeing it. There is a priceless scene in the cartoon that I'm sure will leave you in stitches. When Owl Jolson, our misfit hero, goes to sing at an audition, the viewer sees a bunch of other participants. One of them, a blue bird that looks like it was stoned, starts to show off his ""talent"". What ensues is the funniest piece of animation I have ever seen. I don't want to spoil the moment, but if you don't think that scene is funny, you don't have a sense of humor. It's one of Tex Avery's best cartoons, and is recommended to all ages. It's on the Looney Toons Golden Collection 2, so buy that if you want to experience this classic cartoon.",Plot,,
"Oh dear, if you're diabetic then I would seriously advise against watching this film. It' so sugary it'll rot the brain right out of your head.<br /><br />Why on earth Eastman and Laird allowed this to be made is beyond me. It's soooooooo far removed from their black and white comic book. Okay, I know the cartoon series was too but the first movie did have a hard edge to it. I mean, take a look at the cover-the Turtles are smiling and happy. Then look a cover of one of the original comic books. They're almost always gritting their teeth and frowning. THAT'S how it should be. Not like this.<br /><br />Even the animatronics look fake. The first 2 had a rather believable Splinter but now he's juddering and stiff and obviously operated by a couple of technicians loitering a few feet off camera. His voice is also totally different and he seems a touch more upbeat and lively. HARDLY the way Splinter is supposed to be.<br /><br />The plot itself defies logic and there are massive holes all over the place. With such a dramatic change in locale from New York to Fuedal Japan you'd think the movie would take advantage of that and go nuts with imagination.<br /><br />But sadly not. It just...goes nowhere. I mean, what is the deal with the character of Whit. Why does he look like the great, great, great grandfather of Casey Jones.<br /><br />In fact, the return of Casey is the only reason I am not giving this a 1-star rating. It's a pretty wretched movie but Elias Koteas can make it a tiny bit less unbearable.<br /><br />Hopefully the new cartoon show and the possibility of another (harder) movie will cancel this one out. It's nothing but dated, mindless fodder for under-fives. At the risk of repeating myself; this is NOT how the Turtles should be.<br /><br />Extras are almost non-existent but the animated menus are cool. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is in pretty good shape but the Dolby 5.1 track isn't up to much I'm afraid. The film was originally recorded in Dolby SR so this is obviously a remastering job. It's just adequate is all I'm saying.",Plot,Visual Effect,
"This is a great mystery with superior acting. At the beginning of the film we see Ted Crawford - beautifully played by Anthony Hopkins - who is obviously a brilliant man. His hobby is designing part Rube Goldberg, part perpetual motion devices that use steel balls that travel intricate routes. We also get a quick insight into his huge ego. He's not a lovable guy.<br /><br />We also find that his wife who is exhausted by trying to kowtow to Ted's massive ego is in the midst of an affair. She has kept her identity a secret to her lover, but discovers that her affair is no secret to her husband just before he shoots her in the head. This all takes place in the Crawford's home, and Ted remains there until the SWAT team and negotiator arrives. At that point he readily confesses to the crime and later signs a confession.<br /><br />We next meet Willy Beachum, played by Ryan Gosling, who is with the district attorney's office. However, Willy will not be around for long as he has just accepted a position with a prestigious law firm. Circumstances arise - engineered by Ted - causing the judge to assign the murder case to Willy. Needless-to-say, the case is not the slam dunk that Willy perceives it to be, and thus we have a battle of wits between Ted and Willy whose ego is just about as huge as Ted's though he is a slight bit less obnoxious - although not by much.<br /><br />Obviously, it would be inadvisable of me to disclose the mystery that interferes with the quick resolution of the case and the other elements of the plan so masterfully concocted by Ted. I read one review by a man who said he had figured out the ultimate mystery before the climax of the film. He's a much smarter man than I.<br /><br />Apart from the mystery, the enjoyment of this film comes from the superior acting of the two main characters. Anthony Hopkins certainly has a way of excellently portraying brilliant homicidal men, and he gives us a delicious one in this film. I would have not thought that Ryan Gosling could do as well as he did in his part. His performance is a pleasant surprise - for me, at least.<br /><br />Finally the DVD offers us a look at two alternate endings. I usually don't think the alternate endings change the film much, but the decision to change to the final ending makes this film so much better by strengthening the one big mystery of the film.<br /><br />If you're into mysteries and great acting, give Fracture a spin.",Plot,Performance,
"Gary Cooper, Susan Hayward, and Richard Widmark are on a trip through the wilds of Mexico in search of gold. Hayward's husband was injured in a cave-in at the mine, and she has offered the party a share of the wealth if they will help her injured husband. It sounds simple enough, but there's only one small problem--a band of Apaches that are on the hunt for white scalps. However, the lure of the prospects of wealth spur the group on to the mine, and they reach the mine, save the husband, but now face the dangers posed by the Apaches.<br /><br />Each character offers some sense of presence to the film; Cooper is able to portray the silent, strength of character person, while Widmark adds a philosophical, yet cynical, view of life in his role as Fiske, a gambler.

"The Toast of New York, despite the lavish look, top-notch cast and occasional bursts of energy, is a ten-ton bore - chiefly, I think, because of the long-winded script and pedestrian direction. Others have commented on the production difficulties and personnel changes which may be responsible for the bland result. Early in the story we are treated to a colorful but talky exposition which sets the plot in motion: On the day the Civil War starts, Jim Fisk (Edward Arnold), itinerant peddler, and his partners in crime (Cary Grant and Jack Oakie) devise a scheme to buy cotton cheaply in the South, smuggle it North and sell it at a high price to New England mills, thus launching the career of one of the fabled financial speculators of the 19th century. But, instead of the whiz-bang, rise-and-fall saga laced with comedy which this introduction leads us to expect, we get 100 minutes of routine montages followed by more expository talk (mostly about financial deals), interspersed with boisterous crowd scenes and tepid romantic interludes with the exquisite Frances Farmer, who plays Josie Mansfield, an aspiring stage actress who is taken under Fisk's wing. None of this ever rises above the mundane. Edward Arnold gives his familiar robust, take-charge performance (see the 1937 screwball comedy EASY LIVING and the previous year's COME AND GET IT which this film resembles in theme and plot); Grant and Oakie are pretty much themselves as well, though the full impact of Grant's screen charisma is blunted in this non-comic role. Farmer is presented more as a comely production value than a full-blooded character. She spends most of her screen time in a series of splendid period gowns uttering banalities that barely suggest the emotional states of her character. She too played a similar role in COME AND GET IT, to far stronger effect. One would expect this kind of storytelling from a Warners assembly-line quickie, but it's terribly disappointing to encounter it in a 100-minute-plus grade-A production by RKO. I'll give it a ""4"" for Farmer and Arnold.",Plot,Others,
"The technical aspects of the movie was flawless. Govind took a storyline that would usually not appeal to many and made it engrossing throughout the whole duration of the movie. The performances were brilliant, it is questionable why no nominations were offered. Kareena was brilliant as a Muslim riot victim, showing particular prowess in the confession scene. Her deglamourised look only emphasized the strength of her performance.Fardeen and Kareena's chemistry was impeccable and they give one of bollywood's memorable kiss sequences. Fardeen Khan was surprisingly good, flitting through all his scenes well. This was one of Amitabh's best performances and given his track record, you know how good it must have been. Om Puri too was excellent in his role as a villain. The songs were nice and did not interrupt the plot. Kareena's singing of ""Jab nahin aye the thum"" only enhanced the movie. The other songs ""Rangdini "" and ""Allah allah"" have the correct emotional nuances in them. Dev was flawless.",Plot,Performance,Music

"Driving a truckful of posies for a florist seems about as safe an occupation an ex-con could hope for. But for John Payne in Phil Karlson's Kansas City Confidential, it gets him framed for a million-two robbery. His trouble is that you can set a clock by his punctual rounds, and that one of his deliveries coincides with the arrival of the armored car at the bank next door. His comings and goings have been meticulously stop-watched by the mastermind of the heist (Preston Foster), a disgruntled policeman forced into retirement who seeks his weird sort of revenge. <br /><br />Foster's plan assembles a gang who wear masks during the plotting so they can't recognize one another, or him. Payne's just the innocent fall guy who's thrown to the cops. Those cops try to beat a confession out of him, but it won't stick. He nonetheless loses his job and ends up on the front pages as the prime suspect. So he goes on the earie and follows the robbers (Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef and Neville Brand) down to Mexico, where they're to meet with `Mr. Big' again and divvy up the take. <br /><br />The spanner in the works proves to be Foster's daughter (Coleen Gray), striking sparks with Payne as he poses as one of the conspirators killed in Tijuana en route to the rendezvous. Gray's an aspiring lawyer in ignorance of daddy's scheme  which is to turn over the robbers, thus rehabilitating himself with the force, and to collect the insurers' reward of $300-large. <br /><br />Those south-of-the-border resort bungalows, during the noir cycle at any rate, were hotbeds of passion and gunplay. Karlson gives us a little of the former (not his long suit) but plenty of the latter. Over cardgames in the lobby and chance meetings amid the subtropical foliage at night, the unknown players try to sniff one another out and gain whatever edge they can. Their final gathering, aboard a boat called the Manana, shakes out as a crashing intersection of cross-purposes.<br /><br />Like Dick Powell, Payne started off as a crooner and hoofer, a light leading man (his best remembered role is as Maureen O'Hara's fiancé in Miracle on 34th Street). But in three films under Phil Karlson's direction (plus Robert Florey's in The Crooked Way and Allan Dwan's in Slightly Scarlet), he ended up one of the most convincing ordinary-guy protagonists in the noir cycle. He's tough, all right, but still shows the flop-sweat of fear; and he's smart, too, but because he's forced to be  what he's trying to hang onto is all he's got. <br /><br />Off-screen, he was even smarter, seeing the potential revenue in color films (like Hell's Island and Slightly Scarlet) when selling to television was at most a pipe dream. But as an actor in the ambiguous world of film noir, he's seldom given the credit he deserves. He's every bit as good as Powell or Glenn Ford, if not quite so emblematic as Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum or Burt Lancaster. Karlson's brutal, accomplished works late in the noir cycle gave Payne his place in the dark sun.",Plot,,
"Bigfoot movies can be fun. This one is terrible. The acting is atrocious (except for Sue Lynn Sanchez), and the script is a mess. Probably the most absurd scene takes place in a ""newspaper office"" (obviously a high school), where an editor patiently explains to a young reporter why mass killings by an unknown animal are of no interest to readers. We're to also believe that this thing is running around, abducting women and ripping people apart, and the state police never arrive and no media circus ensues. Apparently, the families of the women abducted and the people killed just forget the whole thing. The ending is also absurd. Why would a babe like Talla want to spend any time with a loser like the reporter? I won't even get in to how absurd the sasquatch looks, except to point out that the monster is supposed to be a male, since he sexually assaults women -- so why does the costume have breasts? I've given this mess two stars only because of Sue Lynn Sanchez, who is gorgeous and puts in a spirited performance despite her horrible lines.

The writing is non existent and the film constantly runs along as though it was made in the same chronological fashion as the diary format it is narrated in. What you are left with is an odyssey of ""my perverted world and welcome to it"" over and over....and the women in Caveh's relationships almost deteriorate in value during each relationship...only to escape from him which just further tortures him. What his hang ups ensure is that the women in his life may not know what they want, but they know what they don't want....and they don't want Caveh. Why anyone would care about somebody like this or someone who has the deep rooted sexual hang ups like this is curious. Initially, as a viewer you are aligned with Caveh because you are following him as the ""narrator""....and he initially connects the viewer in humorous terms....but as his sexual desires and hang ups persist.....you are left feeling sorry and uncaring for Caveh....which is how his existence comes across by movies end. Yes, some of the women in this film are gorgeous....and perhaps they are the ""hook"" that pulls you in as a viewer...but Caveh's constant mulling over his problems never gives the viewer any belief that Caveh intends to change enough to become the man he needs to be... Call it a fetish lifestyle...but in the end, ""I Am a Sex Addict"" is all about a very selfish, self centered person...who inspires nobody.",Plot,,
"This poverty row adaptation (courtesy of Monogram) of the Charles Dickens classic has about as much finesse as a school pageant, despite the appearance of old pros like Irving Pichel (as Fagin) and Lionel Belmore (as Mr. Bumble). As a matter of fact, while the film has a couple of choice moments in its second half, any good intentions are done in by some serious miscasting: an overage Artful Dodger (Sonny Ray) and Nancy (Doris Lloyd) and, worst of all, an unsympathetic Oliver (Dickie Moore). Rather than proving an asset, its short running time (70 minutes) gives a careless, rushed air to the proceedings and ensures a total absence of the visual poetry which marked David Lean's definitive 1948 version.",Plot,,
"In an unidentified period in the future, nations become just one in the One Nation Earth, leaded by Franco ""Lucifer"" Macalousso (Nick Mancuso). The Christian opposers, leaded by Helen Hannah (Leigh Lewis), are systematically eliminated and Helen is put on trial in the O.N.E. Court of Justice. Her lawyer is Mitch Kendrick (Corbin Bernsen), a man who lost his father, murdered by the followers of Lucifer, and the attorney is his ex-lover Victoria Thorne (Jessica Steen). On the beginning of the trial, Mitch changes the defender, stating that Jesus Christ should be judged, and not his follower Helen, beginning the greatest trial in the history of mankind. The premise of ""Judgement"" is very interesting, but the movie is horrible. The screenplay is awful, having situations, development of characters and lines very shallow, and sometimes very ridiculous. The acting, with the exceptions of Leigh Lewis and Corbin Bernsen, is terrible. The ""actor"" called ""Mr. T"" is unbelievable, probably one of the worst performance I have ever seen. A couple of weeks ago I saw another Christian movie (""Left Behind"") and I liked it, but ""Judgement"" is really a bad movie, for Christians only. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""O Julgamento"" (""The Judgement"")",Plot,Performance,
"Melodramatic romance about Joan (played by Ann Harding), a woman who strongly believes that marriage is ""a business"" and decides that a playboy of her acquaintance, John Fletcher (William Powell), a man with a ""future"" (not to mention a well-trained manservant) is the one for her. She actually falls in love with him, in spite of herself, but he's all playboy and doesn't seem to want to give up the bachelor life. She decides to trick him into marriage by going to his apartment, then changing into ""something cooler"", after which her father shows up, and for some reason Fletcher agrees to marriage. Well, they're already discussing divorce on the honeymoon and decide to wait six months before they get it. Joan is meanwhile busy pressing her husband to work on making his business a success and give up the polo (even though he's not very ambitious and has stated he prefers the life of leisure).<br /><br />Well, this is an interesting, fairly serious film that stands out based on very well done performances by Ann Harding and William Powell. The flaw for me in the film is that I find the male character to be kind of a jerk and can't really see why she's so gung-ho to want this man - personally, I would take a decent, nice guy any day over a wealthy playboy who's always chasing after other women. In general, I would say this woman has been making some pretty poor choices in her life. But one bonus - the film is loaded with gorgeous dresses on all the women, a nice look at some fashions of the day. A decent film, worth seeing.",Plot,Performance,Others
"For years, many fans wondered about what has become known as the ""hybrid version"" of Superman II, which was half directed by Richard Donner and half directed by Richard Lester after Donner was unceremoniously dumped from the project.<br /><br />Superman II was a very strong sequel despite all the production woes, but has not held up nearly as well as the first film, and now plays more like camp in many spots. Was this Lester's influence, or was the plan always to lighten the tone of the sequel to create more of a popcorn film? Well, we all got our answer in 1983, when Superman III debuted, this completely under the guiding hand of Richard Lester.<br /><br />From the film's opening credit sequence, a completely farcical series of events, you get that sinking feeling and realize that anything resembling cheese and slapstick in the second film was directly the influence of Lester. The first Superman was grounded in a sense of reality, even if it was a comic book one, which is noticeably absent from much of Superman II. In the first film, Metropolis always seemed like a real city with real people inhabiting it. The second recalled a city on a sound stage with only the vaguest sense of a distorted reality. Well, the filmmakers decided to distort reality further in Superman III by ignoring what made the franchise great and going with a hipper, more today approach. They accomplished this by centering the film around the casting of Richard Pryor. The problem with this approach is that there is absolutely no reason for Richard Pryor to appear in Superman III other than the fact that he's Richard Pryor.<br /><br />The idea behind Superman III is actually a fairly intriguing one, where a computer genius constructs a super-computer, which in a unique turn of events alters the mental stability of Superman, turning him away from his All-American persona. Suddenly, Superman is no longer the hope for all mankind, but the ""anti Superman"" intent on destroying us. It also contains one of the best moments in the series, as Clark Kent and the evil Superman actually battle each other. It's one of the highpoints of the entire series, yet still can't avoid being disappointing by the overall poor quality of the production.<br /><br />I Thank the heavens that a good 20 minutes of this movie was cut for theatrical release because it just made the pacing even worse!, most of the footage cut was more pointless forced comedy moments and the only high point of the footage being reinserted for the Extended TV Version shown numerous times in the late eighties were the newly created opening credits in space, rather then the credits appearing during the opening montage in the theatrical cut.<br /><br />So what went wrong? I would put the blame squarely at the feet of Lester and the Salkinds, who seemed to want to make a ""Richard Pryor"" Superman movie rather than a film that was true to the spirit of the characters and the original film. Pryor is given far too much screen time despite the fact that he's not even the main villain. The producers obviously figured that, if they're paying Richard Pryor, they may as well use him, whether it benefits the film or not. So what would I have done differently? Well, the plot about a super computer and an altered Superman is a fantastic direction for the film to go, but that's where they left it. I would have eliminated the character of Ross Webster, the ultimate corporate bad guy, and everyone around him in favor of Gus Gorman, the computer genius trying to dominate the world on his own. The Webster character is totally unnecessary and a more maniacal Gorman working in solitude would have been far more menacing But the catch is that with Pryor in the role of Gorman, the producers obviously felt a need to allow him to redeem himself in the end, so I say they should have removed Pryor, too. This could also have cut out much of the unnecessary comic drivel that ruins Superman III.<br /><br />Ultimately, Superman III is not the worst entry in the series, but not for a lack of trying. Richard Lester proved once and for all that he really didn't understand what a Superman movie should be, seemingly relying on British slapstick comedy that is taken right out of an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus ""where it belongs!"" and a pathetic, poor script that he and probably only ten other people found amusing. He must have forgotten that Superman is aimed towards an American audience. The movie does actually start to get good from the moment supes becomes ""anti-supes"", Watching the dual between Clark and Superman really lets you see how the whole movie could have been made ""dark and serious"" and kept out of the silly comedy path ""even with Pryor and other factors etc"" If Superman III had been made this way it probably would have been better then II!. The Superman vs. Clark scene proves this, In Superman II where Zod and Superman battle it out, the end result is disappointing and nothing really happens other then Superman throwing Zod into a Coca-Cola sign, the confrontation in III is far far better!. With all the great characters and history that Superman has encountered, there were really limitless possibilities for this sequel. Unfortunately for fans, we happened to get stuck with filmmakers who obviously were limited in their abilities, talents and taste!. The last 35 minutes of this movie on a whole deserves a 6/10 rating. Why could the other 85 minutes of this movie not of been the same!, The rest of the movie deserves nothing more then a poor...<br /><br />3/10",Plot,Directional Techniques,Others

"I've always been fond of this film. The seemingly intentional mis-marketing as a raunchy comedy is not uncommon for the time, and is really damaging to what is essentially a look at sexual relationships and sexuality. There's a sweet naivety about the films perspective, caught up in the era in which is was released. Not much raunchiness, innuendo base titillation is more the course. As for the comedy there are a few laughs, and they do help alleviate some of the melancholy moments. For me it's in the emotional twists and turns that the film really shows interest and variety.<br /><br />The Kinks wrote and performed the soundtrack. The songs are well constructed with some touchingly sentimental moments. An appreciation of The Kinks would most certainly aid ones appreciation the film, the lyrics embellishing he drama considerably.<br /><br />I'm really surprised this film has been rated so low. How much of that is related to the mis-marketing and an under appreciation of the soundtrack?",Plot,Music,
"Before I start this review, I must admit that when I saw this movie, it was the wee hours of the morning and I was slightly intoxicated. Maybe my judgment was a little off, but I doubt it.<br /><br />'The Park' is a silly 3D horror movie about a haunted amusement park, which just happened to be built on a cemetery. After several deaths at the park, it was closed down. 14 years later, a journalist investigating the park goes missing (naturally). His sister, Yen, is determined to find him, but their mother, a ghost hunter, believes him to be dead already. Regardless of her mother's professional advice, Yen sets out with a group of ghost fodder (her friends) in an attempt to find her brother.<br /><br />Where to begin with this film's faults? There are so many. For starters, the plot is a mess. Unoriginal and full of plot holes. There is nothing close to horror in this. Sure, there are ghosts and other such dead people, but no scares. The 3D effects on which the film was based weren't all that impressive - or even 3D - on the VCD I watched. The dialog (in subtitles) was rather bad. All the characters seem to have a problem in which they felt the need to state the obvious, with everyone saying several times ""There are ghosts!"". I think they got the point after that was said for the billionth time.<br /><br />I will give 'The Park' credit for two things though: More proof that clowns are evil, and the fact that we have very little (to no) character development. It's a great way to determine early on who will die, and who will survive.<br /><br />After thinking about it, this seemed like it was meant to be campy B-movie. The (very blatant) references to 'Mr Vampire' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' prove that, but it still felt like the movie was taking itself too seriously. Sure, I laughed at some bad B-movie moments, but those few moments were surrounded by a whole lot of just plain bad material.<br /><br />1/10 - 'The Park' was very disappointing. Maybe I'll try watching it again sometime, but not any time soon.",Plot,Visual Effect,
"There is a lot that I love about John Lennon, and a lot that I don't like much about him. I was interested in this film initially, but was not all that impressed. I'll try to explain my problems with it. I suppose I should start by saying that it is not all bad, but anybody who looks at this as ""the"" documentary on Lennon is grossly misinformed.<br /><br />In a nutshell, nearly everything in the film had all been said before. It was the first time I felt like I was watching a remake of a documentary! Some people claimed that it was the first time this part of Lennon's life was shown in a documentary, but there was absolutely nothing in this film that hadn't been said elsewhere, be it on film or in a book.<br /><br />I hated the overused ""talking-heads"" format. I had no need to hear what Gore Vidal had to say, particularly when he went on about Lennon representing ""life"" and Nixon and George Bush representing ""death"". Whatever. I'm not their biggest fan either, but that was pure sensationalism. It's not clear which Bush he was talking about, but Vidal takes every chance he gets to make pompous, oversimplified statements like that.<br /><br />Geraldo Rivera? You've got to be kidding! <br /><br />I just wasn't always sure if the film had anything more to say than ""John Lennon ruled and Richard Nixon sucked."" Does anybody who is going to see this film really need to be told that to the degree that this film tells the audience? While I'm at it, I hated the film's ad campaign. It centered upon the above Vidal quote and counted on people who didn't do their own thinking to applaud it as wholly original and profound. The fact that it bastardized ""War Is Over... If You Want It"" by making it the film's tagline irritated me, especially since the film wasn't supposed to be about war! Even if you read into it and say that it was about a war between Nixon and Lennon, I still say that's a flimsy reason.<br /><br />David Leaf is usually much more impressive than this. I, for one, value his work as Brian Wilson's biographer. This film, however, just seemed to be capitalizing on the current documentary craze. It used to be that a viewer could be enlightened and educated by almost every documentary that made its way into cinemas. Not anymore, though. This one simply staples together other, BETTER documentaries about the same stuff. Want to learn about Lennon? Read a book. Watch better Lennon documentaries like Imagine: John Lennon. That film wasn't perfect either, but at least it showed John at his best and at his worst. The U.S. vs. John Lennon is simply John worship that spends so much time treating him like a legend, it forgets to treat him like a man.<br /><br />I probably would not have felt so negatively had I seen this one on television instead of in a cinema. It was partly produced by VH1, and that's really where it belongs. At least on VH1, it can be taken with a grain of salt alongside I Love the 80s: 1982 and Flava of Love. (Okay, okay, that last part was pretty low, I admit it. I apologize.) I can't say that I hated the whole thing. There were some pretty interesting interviews, particularly the one with John Sinclair. His contribution was the best part of the film. They also made at least some efforts (i.e. two or three I think) to bring in opposing viewpoints so they could say they were being objective.<br /><br />Above everything else, it is always a pleasure to listen to Lennon, even when he wasn't thinking much about what he said. Yes, friends, even Lennons make mistakes. Either way, his interviews were pretty well used in this film. I walked away really wishing that John were still around to state his case for himself retrospectively.",Plot,Others,
"A young girl (Nami) inherits a house where she lived until she was 3, and she and her ex-boyfriend go check it out.

Nami knew the house belonged to her father but that's all, she didn't know who her father was. Apparently he was a great artist, but from some of the other things that they found in the house he had other interests too. Not wholesome ones, either. One of my complaints lies in the making of the movie, wherein certain parts are made to look like a video game, so you're never sure if you're seeing a game or the movie. However, considering that I've seen ""House of the Dead"" which is the worst-ever movie-based-on-a-video-game, this is done quite well and was more intriguing and mysterious.

"Hotel for Dogs plays it very safe and sticks to a tried-and-true children's movie formula. For a great many viewers the best thing about the film will be the cute and cuddly dogs that perform various tricks  their training is easily more impressive than the humdrum story, based on a hopefully more consequential Lois Duncan book. The dialogue lacks flair, the acting is expectedly simple, and the characters provide only modest entertainment in comparison to their canine costars. Adults will probably find it difficult to withstand the sickeningly sweet conclusion or the impossibly artificial mechanics behind the inner workings of the dog hotel, but the target audience is likely to be pleased. <br /><br />16-year-old Andi (Emma Roberts) and her 11-year-old brother Bruce (Jake Austin) have bounced back and forth between orphanages and foster parents (five in the last three years) without finding comfort or satisfaction. Bernie (Don Cheadle), the kindly social worker who governs their placements tries to reason with the children, who aren't content with their newest family of quiver-inducing wannabe rockstars (Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon) who conduct obnoxious band practice in their apartment nonstop, and compulsively lock up the cupboards and cabinets in their home. The brother and sister team have also been secretly keeping a pet dog, Friday, who uses automated gadgets constructed by the mechanically inclined Bruce to get food and to remain hidden.<br /><br />Before school starts up, the troublemaking duo (they get money for dog food by pawning fraudulent goods) comes across an abandoned hotel with several canine occupants. Deciding to look after their newfound family of dogs, Andi and Bruce join forces with two employees from the nearby pet store (Johnny Simmons and Kyla Pratt) along with nosey Mark (Troy Gentile), to build an elaborate self-maintained shelter for unwanted, abandoned and stray dogs. Initially it seems they've bitten off more than they can chew, especially when cruel dog pound troops, nagging foster parents and pesky cops begin to take notice of the incredibly large gathering of dogs at the dilapidated old building. <br /><br />The target audience probably won't be asking the questions that popped into my mind: How can an 11-year-old kid build such intricate mechanical contraptions? Is it really that easy to train dozens of dogs to use said electrical gadgets? Is it simply luck that none of the dogs need medical attention? Is it really okay for children to commit crimes such as breaking and entering, trespassing, and even assault, as long as it's done with the intent of saving stray animals? Clearly this film wasn't designed for me, but the trite dialogue (Kevin Dillon mutters the stale line, ""We're in deep doo doo,"" after falling into an enormous animal waste bin), the predictability of Bernie's role, the sappy ending and the Kill Bill music montage (Tomoyasu Hotei's instantly recognizable ""Battle Without Honor or Humanity"") are huge distractions  especially when one just wants to see some adorable dogs running amok. <br /><br />- Mike Massie",Plot,,
"Over-the-hill gumshoe in Los Angeles seeks to avenge the killing of an old pal, another detective who had gotten himself involved in a case concerning a murdered broad, stolen stamps, a nickel-plated handgun, a cheating dolly, and a kidnapped pussycat. Art Carney and Lily Tomlin are amazingly well-matched playing the convincingly mismatched pair who unravel the tangled mystery, and Bill Macy is equally fine as a friendly bartender-cum-talent agent. The plot of this modern-day paean to the age of Raymond Chandler is perhaps too convoluted to follow in-depth, but that's rather easy to overlook considering it is the least important part of the picture. The begrudging, barb-filled relationship between Carney and Tomlin carries the show, and the friendship that slowly grows between them is thrilling for fans of this type of cinema. A lovely character study/comedy-drama richly deserved--yet did not get--Oscar nominations for all three of its acting principals (it did receive one nomination, for Robert Benton's original screenplay).

I have not seen any Ed Wood movies, but I imagine that they will be similar. Radioactive Dreams is relentlessly annoying. If you thought that the word Focker was used too many times in Meet The Parents, wait until Marlowe repeats ""we are slick dicks!"" for the tenth time. I have always hated the use of period slang and this movie uses 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's slang in it's horde of cliched characters from four decades. Notice that movies that used a lot of slang that were made during these decades are now either unintentionally funny or unbelievably inferior. There was a hope in me during the movie that Michael Dudikoff would die a horrible death. He is honestly that annoying. John Stockwell appears to have no spine in both this and Dangerously Close.

"Official reviews of this latest film from David Lynch descried it at best as ""opaque"", ""hard to summarize"" and ""to be experienced rather than explained"", to at worst ""indulgent"", ""complete nonsense"" and made without consideration for the audience. However, in defense of David Lynch, for one who has followed a number of his films Inland Empire holds a coherent and linear narrative, and one that most novice Lynch viewers can follow with a few pointers. As with many of Lynch's films, much of the narrative is played out in the main character's subconscious or dreamscape. Arguable in the case of Inland Empire this is true for the entire film. There a few mechanism's Lynch has used in a number of films that recur here to highlight this. In particular floor-to-ceiling red drapes (best known for the ""Black Lodge"" of Twin Peaks) indicate the subconscious, and the character moving through the drapes either indicates a deeper delving in to the subconscious or an elevation towards reality. Also a static room populated with strange characters usually indicates the very depths of the subconscious and typically as a character approaches this room this indicates a complete detachment from reality and decent in to psychosis. It is important to note, as with Mulholland Drive, the principle character the audience is introduced to  Nikki (as played by Laura Dern)  is not the protagonist. It is the protagonist's most prominent extension of herself in her own subconscious, though not necessarily the only one. The genuine protagonist makes a brief appearance half way through the film with only one line of dialogue. The basic story is of ""a woman in trouble"" as quoted by Lynch. This can be expanded on with a number of options without spoiling the film (Lynch's real skill is making films that are practically impossible to spoil). This troubled woman is a neglected, possibly abused, wife who could possibly be a stranger in a foreign land thus furthering her alienation. However she has dreams of much greater things  hence her subconscious extension of herself as Nikki (Laura Dern), a desirable movie star. In her real life she pursues her dream through a one-sided affair with a Lothario type figure. She is jilted by her lover and is left with an unwanted pregnancy. She loses the baby  ""her son""  either through a beating from her husband, or a self inflicted or back street abortion. At this point she may or may not murder her husband. Either way guilt, anger and abandonment combine with her existing feelings of alienation to accelerate her downward spiral. The usual hard drugs and sex follow, further increasing the protagonist's desire to detach from reality. Ultimately she dies, either physically or through a complete and permanent detachment from reality  as indicated by the brief uniting of her happy family, son included. In this context, be it however close to Lynch's vision, all the imagery of the film can be interpreted and the plot followed from beginning to end. Lynch always leaves his films open to interpretation, and he is especially reluctant to explain his stories  the above ""a woman in trouble"" was his most forthcoming explanation of this film when pushed. This is definitely a film for the viewer to choose to be engaged and not simply an indulgence by and for David Lynch himself.",Plot,,

But, when you look at the body of work and more importantly the intelligence and multi-level approach of Scorcese's other films, this film completely fails in comparison.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way this film was butchered, (pun intended) whether it was by the studio, by Scorcese, or by the batch of writers who's conflicting visions and machismo keep bobbing up and down throughout the story. I believe Scorcese (or the studio) tried too hard to make a film for ""today's (young) audience"" instead of just making (or letting Scorcese make) a Scorcese film. Sure, perhaps many of today's brainwashed and dumbed down proles might not get it, but the film would have entertained the large following this director has cultivated over his many years behind the camera. If the only story he wanted to tell was a nobody wins revenge tale without redemption, flanked by an extremely shallow and cookie-cutter romance, then why waste all the time and money with 1860's New York? Whether or not Martin is actually washed up or still possesses his own magical abilities with a camera I cannot say, but it seems that whatever his original vision was, someone went through it (violently) with a cleaver.<br /><br />It's interesting though, as a comparison, the actual base human story of ""Titanic"" has the same cookie-cutter romance elements as ""Gangs"" yet it is crystal clear that the FOCUS of ""Titanic"" is on an IMMACULATE portrayal of both the ship itself, the passengers, and the events that took place -- an accurate portrayal of history is the most important factor. ""Gangs"" does not present that same sharp and exacting historical focus to any degree, instead bits of chopped up pseudo history and gruesome violence are thrown around for a bit color in an otherwise monochromatic, by the books, and boring love story.<br /><br />Bottom line: I can hear this bomb falling right now...

"I've seen hundreds, possibly thousands of movies. I sat through the abomination that was Tomb Raider 2. I watched the blindness producing Torque all the way through. But this.....this was just unwatchable.<br /><br />I love action/martial arts movies...who doesn't? But this is just awful. First it starts off with some exciting action, then degrades into a truly spectacular piece of crap, with a giant, a wizard, and a monkey man.<br /><br />Yes, I'm being serious.<br /><br />Once we met the wizard, I turned it off. No action in the world was good enough to make me keep watching.<br /><br />This movie had some truly awful acting, even for Thai movies this was bad. The action? boring, with one or 2 memorable scenes which I already saw on the trailer. The hero? only uses his knees. watching him kick the crap out of people the same exact way for 20 minutes gets boring...fast.<br /><br />Special effects?

"I saw this film on cable not long after its release and remember enjoying it. But like most films, it didn't leave a lasting impression. For some reason I have had a DVD copy of the film in my collection for some time now, probably a b-day gift or some such, and I never watch itLast night, sixteen years after it first appeared, I watched it again.<br /><br />Sometimes, a piece of art takes time and multiple exposures for its audience to fully appreciate its quality. This is definitely the case with this film. For me, a film should show me new characters or new settings or give me a new way of looking at a recognizable situation. So often films just give their audience the same tired stereotypical content; Characters that differ in name only from other films and plot lines that so closely follow previous successful productions that I'm surprised there aren't more lawsuits between artists. Such is not the case with ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"". With the tiny exception of the girlfriend of the chief supporting character, every role can accurately be described as unique. A butcher shop owner/operator (Nancy Travis) for a leading lady that may be wielding her cleaver in the off hours plus her curiously flighty sister (Amanda Plummer). A suburban San Francisco family of intensely Scottish decent that includes the youngest son with an enormous head and a Mother (Brenda Fricker) who has no qualms about French kissing her eldest son's best friend just to assure herself he's good at it. There's a light aircraft charter pilot (Steven Wright) that probably shouldn't have been awarded a license and a slightly embittered, slightly maniacal former Alcatraz guard/now tour guide (Phil Hartman) who makes me laugh just to look at him on screen. There's an undercover cop best friend (Anthony LaPaglia) that wanted to be Starsky or Hutch but instead learns the job really entails filling out a lot of forms and his boss (Alan Arkin) who, if it wasn't for Mike Myer's performance, would have stolen the movie with his portrayal of a Police Chief that can only be described as the antithesis of that character that we've seen so many times in films and TV.<br /><br />About Mike Myers: Intensely likable. Free and easy on film at a young age he creates two wonderful characters that make us laugh hard throughout. As the lead Charlie McKenzie and as his father Stuart, Myers keeps the film moving with his paranoid yet irresistible charm from Charlie and his Robin Williamsesque quips that flow from his two characters accomplishing the most difficult task for such a performance; namely, entertain without distracting from the story.<br /><br />I've added this film to my ""Favorites"" list and recommend it highly. If you liked ""You Can't Take it With You"" you'll love this more contemporary yet equally quirky film of love and family.",Plot,,
"Talking about success of 36 China Town is also talking about repeated success of its directors duo Abbas Mustan who started off as directors in Hindi films more than 15 years ago with a flop Agneekaal (1990). Such a high success rate that is increasingly getting rare in the Hindi film industry is a miracle in itself. The reason that I can think of is with each of their film they reinvented themselves. Therefore, in this musical masala thriller flick, their audience not just getting a taste of a regular Abbas-Mustan stuff but something extra and therefore that bit of surprise element is always there. Like always, their scripts are very ordinary and plot quite common, but their presentation, treatment and handling make all the difference. In this flick for example, they crafted a thriller that is the core but as usual is not great and neither is their suspense but surely this is not a genre film and therefore they bring the elements of comedy (the highlight of the film), Romance, Foot-tapping Music as well as sufficient skin show make all the difference. Therefore we have Kareena, Payal Rohatgai, Tanushree Dutta, Ishaa Koppikar, Sambhavana Sheth all displaying either their legs or their cleavage, the male counterpart is taken care of solely by the model-turned-actor Upen Patel (a confident debut though need to work hard on his dialog accent). Also, direction flaws are galore-How can a body of a 6"" female be fitted into a luggage of 3""?, How can the same luggage thrown inside the A/C. compartment of a running train that too from the train's window?, how can two people see that a tunnel is approaching while traveling in the same train? and how come police not able to find passport of Kareena Kapoor at the murder site when someone has dropped it there. But come on, how many of us really care for such silly logics? Dialogues by Anurag Prapanna & Jitendra Parmar definitely tickle your funny bone at places. Himesh Reshammiya is rocking here too with another hit soundtrack under his belt. Editing by AM's Bhai is crisp as usual. Imagine, a whodunit flick which is treated in a lighter vein, with lot of drama but no melodrama plus hardly any action, is what makes this fare, a surprising watchable stuff, is all can be said about the film..",Plot,Performance,
"Alright I'm almost not sure where is should start with this movie it was that bad. First of all the acting in the movie was absolutely terribly except for one minute part in the movie where Washington dies, she was the only person who showed emotion when she actually died. And other than her no one else looked like they were taking it seriously. As for the flow of the movie it was at least partly smooth, there were parts where it was choppy but it wasn't that bad. As for how believable the story line was, I'm not ashamed to say that is horrendously bad. There is no way that those secret service men wouldn't have noticed a gun barrel pointing out of the window at the beginning of the movie. Also the chance that the little boy would just happen to be a survivor is so slim that it makes it absurd and it is just obvious that it was a bad plot hole. The endingwhere do I start it was just bad. The whole love story between the doctor and the president was obviously thrown in there just to how a little side plot, and it didn't work very well at all. And just the way the president asked her to come to the white house was so corny and clichéd.",Plot,Performance,

The myth of the story is nicely involved in the plot and the special effects are mostly good. However, there are a lot of plot holes and/or goofs (many concerning gravity or what should be the absence of gravity). The actors and actresses are good but not stellar, but Karyo however is very good as Taggart.

"This movie shows the life of Harry Voss, from being a child with a romantic vision of the world to becoming a frustrated alcoholic. Only the third part is based on the short story ""The copulating mermaid of Venice, California"" by Charles Bukowski. But its development is so intense that it required two other chapters in order to make it even more meaningful. It mixes nice and entertaining images with black, depressing scenes and the end might not be everybody's taste. As one of the songs of the movie puts it, love hurts but it can also kill. Although the film can be funny at times it is mainly sad and it will not leave any spectator indifferent.",Plot,Music,
"Though I find most of US reality TV-series quite boring I must admit that's the one I really love. Mainly because it's so global, mixture of different cultures and traditions. You can see difference between developing countries and developed countries and so on. It's fun to watch teams pushing themselves over the top with some rather weird quests and having an arguments over nothing. The tasks are usually tied with the country they're competing and that's very cool too.<br /><br />The series budget is huge. They were racing in Estonia (Where I live :) in summer and my friend took part of it too and revealed how the show was being made. It's just amazing, local TV stations were paid for not to show or write anything about the series. Every smaller detail is checked and must complete the checklist of 5 pages of contract. The story also is usually confirmed on the very last minute after searching for optimal tasks and routes by the producers. And that is what makes the show special.<br /><br />Only thing I don't like in the series is the fact that some conflicts are shown too prolixly. For example when one of those black sisters called Luke ""bitch"" in the last season.<br /><br />But otherwise it's brilliant show and I think everybody find it exciting when one bothers to watch it.",Plot,,

Anyway, they get there through a generic boosting an atrocious ""this-is-the-incongruous-love-song-theme-get-use-to-it-it'll-come-back-throughout"" and then the legacy unveil itself, literally.<br /><br />Well, let's just say lovely Ross and tough Elliott fared better with their subsequent collaborations adapting Louis L'Amour stuff. I must say that after seeing that ""Legacy"" film, I'm a bit confused; I find myself wandering what the hell did they saw in that shallow script devoid of suspense, unexpectedness and more importantly of defined characters. One have to pay the rent (or the ranch) I suppose.<br /><br />It's a real shame 'cause I'm one of these freaks who loved Mrs Ross' Stepford Wives so the possibility of seeing her in another fantastic/horror flick did thrilled me.

"Before 'Another 48 Hours' was released, things were already in an uproar. Nick Nolte and others involved with the movie, vowed never to work with Eddie Murphy again. There were constant spats on the set with the biggest complaint that Murphy would arrive three hours late for filming while everyone would have to set around and wait for him to show up. If the above was true, Murphy is not the one to blame for the movies failure. 'Another 48 Hours' offers no surprises, originality and a ""plot"" that has been recycled over and over again.<br /><br />Co-written by the director of the first installment, Walter Hill, (who had years to come up with something good) gives the fans of the original a HUGE letdown. The opening scene has three bikers cruising all over the country blowing innocent people away and apparently they work for a major drug dealer known as Iceman that Jack Cates (Nick Nolte)has been trying to track down for years. The Iceman wants Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) dead for reasons that go unexplained throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />Cates job goes on the line when he kills a suspect who's gun cannot be found after the shooting. The suspect is burned to a crisp in a gasoline fire but the one important clue is unbelievably sparred.<br /><br />So Cate calls on Murphy to assist in saving the day and while the chemistry between the two was so good in the original '48 Hours,' something is now wrong. Nolte and Murphy don't seem to be enjoying themselves. They are not having fun. And either am I.<br /><br />The routine plot becomes more routine as the writers seem to know that the movie is not funny and try their best to distract the audience with endless car chases, shootouts, and the likes. One unintentional laugh I got was watching a bus roll over a dozen times at 50 miles an hour with Murphy in it but later seeing him walk away without a scratch. And the so called surprise when the identity of the Iceman is revealed is about as believable as Frosty The Snowman. (Perhaps the Iceman would be a better bad guy in Spider Man 3).<br /><br />Eddie, come back to us. We miss you.<br /><br />",Plot,,
"The best Audie Murphy films are the ones he plays outlaws. That gave an unusual touch to the films, you never knew how it was going to come out at the end. In ""The Kansas Raiders"", and also on his last film, he was Jesse James. Here, he rides with the Daltons, their chief is Bob Dalton (Noah Beery Jr.) and they plan three bank robberies at the same time. This film is pure fun from beginning to end, with great action scenes, after all it was directed by Budd Boetticher, whose westerns are like wine: they get better as they get older. The two women, Beverly Tyler and Yvette Duguay are quite strong characters, also unusual in this type of westerns. There are spectacular moments like when they are surrounded in a town and try to escape, with Yvette Duguay helping by turning a track on a circular platform. Also when they hold up the two banks in Coffeyville at the same time. If you enjoy a good western, this one is a must.",Plot,Performance,Directional Techniques
"A young gay man from the sticks comes to New York City in 1969 hoping for a better life, but finds the homosexual lifestyle just as stifled in the big city under police pressure, corruption and harassment. The legendary gay riots near the Stonewall Inn take up just five minutes of the film's running-time, the final five minutes. This low-budget, brightly-colored film is more interested in the lives that would soon be affected by the riots than in the aftermath of the violence--and so we get stock characters like the naive blond cowboy, the underworld group controlling the club, the straight-seeming activists for a Homosexual Alliance, and lots and lots of drag queens. Director Nigel Finch seems to make a concerted effort to equate homosexuality with drag behavior, and drag behavior with (ultimately) prostitution. Perhaps this was true of the times, but Finch's presentation (though not campy) has cartoonish leanings and nostalgic overtures that don't express anything more than what most people already realize: the cops were corrupt, the gays were not saints, and they clashed. There's a good movie to be made about Stonewall, but this one just scratches the surface. There are some sweet moments (a sing-along on a bus, a dance between a drag queen and a gay conservative), but just as many scenes where the tone intended hasn't a hope in hell of coming through. ** from ****",Plot,,
"Name everything that's bad about recent comedies: the pointless gross-out humour, the gratuitous celebrity cameos, the wafer-thin plot, the fat/ugly jokes, the punchline-less jokes that consist of nothing but a reference to ephemeral American popular culture. Pretty good, but there's something missing - that one missing ingredient in this boiling pot of cinematic calamity.<br /><br />And in Zohan, Adam Sandler appears to have found that one component required for this perfect storm of bad movie-making to occur - racist jokes. The vast majority of ""jokes"" in Zohan consist of little more than ""Jews are penny-pinching cheats"" or ""Arabs are poor, stupid goat herders"". What little characterisation anyone who is not Adam Sandler gets is either ""hummus-eating weirdo"" (Israeli) or ""angry cab-driving terrorist"" (Palestinian).<br /><br />The plot is abandoned relatively fast in favour of Zohan having sex with lots of old ladies, and a nonsensical climax involving Mariah Carey shamelessly plugging her album.

It's like a roller coaster: it has many twists and turns, you never know what'll happen next, thrilling, exiting, and fun.<br /><br />The story is supposed to be in real time.

"For some reason, I hadn't seen this film before. I was in the army from 67-70 (did not go to Vietnam) and have read, written, and watched films about that time ever since. Burt Lancaster was...Burt Lancaster. He had some great lines, but I agree with the reviewer who commented on his age being a bit of a distraction. But the story more than compensated. This was when Americans in general had never heard of Vietnam. Burt's amazement that a draftee would be there spoke volumes about how early in our engagement this was. Yet, there were engagements. The US military was actively supporting the south Vietnamese, including fighting battles on the ground and giving air support. The ensemble cast felt like a stereotypical war movie cast, but the lighter dialogue in the first half of the film starts to give way to the seriousness of the situation. And finally, by the end of the film's ""second act"" it takes on more of an ""alamo"" feeling.<br /><br />Burt's character's cynicism, plus the viewers' historical knowledge of how things turned out for the US military in Vietnam, makes for some powerful moments. It also leads me to consider this an anti-war film. Because in the end, what did all the soldiers who died in the movie die for? As Burt's Major tells the hung-ho captain, this isn't like world war II. This one is just running us in circles. He knew the score in 1964, but unfortunately it was generals like Dolph Sweet's character who drove the policies that LBJ followed that resulted in so many more needless deaths.",Plot,,
"""Two"" was a show on TV during the mid-90s. It was on the air, at the same time as several other late-night adventure-dramas. In fact, I thought that the 90s seemed to be the last great era of TV adventure shows. Don't know why, but I suspect folks just don't find the adventure show genre as appealing as they once did. Who knows?? I watched ""Two"" on a local syndicated station every Saturday night, and it came on after the 11:00 news. It starred hunky Michael Easton as the main character, named Gus McClain. Gus McClain was an earnest, milquetoast college professor, who led a nice, tame life.<br /><br />Everything was great for Gus, until he found his wife had been suddenly murdered one day. This show had the exact same premise as the ""Fugitive"" series. Instead of chasing a one-armed culprit, Gus McClain finds that his own evil twin brother, Booth, had committed his wife's murder. And Gus vows to capture Booth, and bring him to justice.<br /><br />There's just one hitch though-the FBI thinks Gus committed the crime, since they've no way of knowing that Gus has a twin brother. It gets even more complicated, when Booth kills one of the pursuing FBI agent's partner. This FBI agent then becomes insanely obsessed with capturing Gus. And she almost does, on more than one occasion during the series run. But Gus always manages to slip through her proverbial 'grasp'.<br /><br />Basically the whole series is based on Gus capturing Booth, before the FBI can get Gus. Nothing new about this type of cat-and-mouse scenario. Anyone who watches TV with any frequency, has seen it all before. I'd say the only reason to watch ""Two"", is if you happen to be a Michael Easton fan. Otherwise, ""Two"" is, at best, a mediocre adventure show.",Plot,,
"This movie seems to make people think of Highlander. I disagree. It's as much Highlander as it is Excalibur. The plot is nothing spectacular or original, and does remotely resemble Highlander, but it certainly ain't no Highlander. Heck, even Star Wars looks remotely like Highlander. It's all a case of level of abstraction from the story. But enough about that.

"THE KILLING HOUR is an American movie made in the same vein as an Italian Giallo.<br /><br />Whilst many may assume by the director's Italian name that this movie is a giallo, I can most assure them that it is not.<br /><br />The director of this movie also directed HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Having liked that movie and also being tempted by the attractive DVD cover depicting a gloved hand over a woman's face, I had high hopes for THE KILLING HOUR.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is actually very interesting. A police detective and a TV show host form an unlikely alliance in tracking down the ""handcuff killer"". Also entering the scene is a young clairvoyant with the ability to draw pictures based on her premonitions.<br /><br />But the interesting aspect of the movie finishes here. The plot is really all that it has going for it.<br /><br />In the hands of an experienced Italian director - Dario Argento, Mario Bava or Lucio Fulci - this movie could have made a great giallo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie was placed in the wrong hands and the superb concept on paper degenerates to a crashing bore on the screen.<br /><br />The director of this movie obviously failed to understand that there is more to making a giallo than just the mere presence of a glove-wearing killer, a few arrogant cops, and occasional nudity and sleaze.<br /><br />The movie is severely hampered by Mr Mastroianni's pedestrian direction that is without suspense, tension or the ability to invoke emotion.<br /><br />The few killing scenes to be found are nothing to write home about and most last too short a time to have sufficient impact upon the viewer - or even the plot for that matter!<br /><br />Without revealing spoilers, I can reveal that there is a killer in this movie - mostly unseen. But the killer shows very little threat or menace and as such it is almost impossible for the viewer to attach themselves to situations that should be tense, frightening and horrific.<br /><br />Without revealing spoilers, I can also mention the presence of another scene in this movie outside of the killings but was clearly meant to be disturbing. But even this scene lacked any impact.<br /><br />The two lead actors are incredibly bland with one-dimensional characters that can be found in any random American movie of this period.<br /><br />Kenneth McMillan basically ""phones in"" his performance as a police lieutenant. Believe me, he was more interesting to watch in the infinitely superior SALEM'S LOT, a movie in which he had several great scenes.<br /><br />On a positive note, Elizabeth Kemp delivers a good performance as the clairvoyant. But she is clearly restrained by a script lacking inspiration and a director lacking a coherent vision for the character.<br /><br />Overall, I do not recommend this movie at all. I would, however, advise people to see HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE because I believe the director did a much better job on this earlier effort.

The 4th member is child computer genius Edward, an eccentric girl to say the least. All 4 of these people have a past that confronts them during the course of the series and is resolved.<br /><br />The series is short, merely 26 episodes, and the story telling is minimalist also (truly post-modern) yet each episode is complete. The way that the characters interact with each other is simple and believable. The animation is exactly what it needs to be, not overly reliant on pyrotechnics nor so bare that it looks incomplete. The action sequences rival anything Hollywood has ever done and the direction leaves nothing to be desired. The visuals of the show have an ultra-modern feel without the sense of lacking one would get from looking at other modern visual art such as an Andy Warhol painting or a skyscraper.<br /><br />Special attention should be paid to the music, which is in one word incredible. Elements of jazz, blues, rock, and other various types are traceable in the show's score. Imagine Mozart but less rigid, or Wagner but more down-to-earth, and a lot more varied than either.<br /><br />In summary, this show is simply excellent.

You expect her to whip out a cigarette and give forth with some snappy dialogue. Dialogue???.....did people ever really speak that way? Somehow I think not. I'm surprised MST3K never did this film but maybe it's funnier without added comment.<br /><br />I cannot imagine what the director Dick Powell was thinking?

Maybe the answer lies in the fact that Howard Hughes who was not noted for his wise decisions was the head of RKO at the time.<br /><br />The down side of this film is the fact that the majority of those involved were all stricken with cancer possibly as a result of filming in an atomic/hydrogen bomb testing ground.

Anyone that loves Italian food, will love the talk and images of the meals that are created throughout the movie. If only we had the technology to truly capture the aromas of the food, then the only thing missing would be to actually be on the set and taste it all.<br /><br />I also found it also rather sexy. I won't comment on the appeal of the suave Italian lead men, but the ladies were just beautiful. A couple of my favourites Isabella Rossellini and Minnie Driver grab lots of sexy shots and the early role from Allison Janney is a pleasant surprise. Like other movies centered around food, the food itself adds to the sex appeal of the movie.<br /><br />Best line of the movie - ""what's the matter?...my Mother was such a terrible cook"". The small part of the car salesman played by Campbell Scott contributes more than its fair share of great lines, incl...""beautiful place though, Italy...yes it is, have you been?...no, never"".<br /><br />I've had the soundtrack for quite some time and I use it to accompany activity in the kitchen or dinner music, but I got a better appreciation of it seeing it in the context of the movie again.<br /><br />The movie conjures up feelings of passion, perseverance, love and pride, as well as providing glimpses of a deeper understanding and appreciation for the human heart.

"I enjoy watching all types of Bollywood and Indian films, from the serious (Monsoon Wedding, Fire) to the epic (Veer-Zaara, Lagaan) to the lightweight (Chalte Chalte, No Entry). I expected this film to fall into the last category and to be entertained. I was not. I couldn't wait for the film to end. It began with some pretentious speeches by Abhishek Bachchan's character about rebelling against the community's expectations of its youth. Other than that, the film tries to amusing and seriously believes itself to be. It relies heavily on the good looks of its stars, the aforementioned Abhishek and Rani Mukherjee. Essentially the plot revolves around the characters of Abhishek and Rani traveling around Indian pulling heists of various sizes and living it up. None of the heists are interesting (certainly not in an ""Ocean's 11"" kind of way) at all, and the musical numbers in the film are... well so boring I can't remember a single one. The soundtrack is also terrible. I listened to it before I watched the film, and absolutely hated it! Amitabh Bachchan also stars, and while I can't really criticize his performance, his role is terribly flat. The film is too bland to be truly terrible, however I will still give it a rating of a ""2"" for wasting so much talent (Rani and Amitabh) and for going nowhere with what could have been an interesting premise.",Plot,Performance,Music
"I'm being forced to watch this in my English class. I can't believe how horrid this is. Charles Dance puts Maxim De Winter to shame. He is not charming, not handsome and he lacks the inner turmoil that is very much a part of the character. And Emilia Fox.. she is too sweet, too innocent and also lacks the character's struggle to develop her own personality. Mrs. Danvers is just bad. She is not at all evil or sinister like the Mrs. Danvers in the book. Also, the mood of the story is supposed to be dark and very gothic. It's dark alright but not it's only dark because the lighting is horrendous. It doesn't set the mood of the story it just makes it seem like they are acting in a studio with only one light. The outside of Manderlay is not what you'd expect. It is bright, cheerful and sunny. In drastic contrast to the dark mood of the story. Also, the flashbacks including Rebecca really took away from her mystery.. they personified her breaking down the magical barrier that seems to have built up around her. It's a distracting point of the movie. All in all, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. And I work in a video store so I watch a lot of movies. If you can avoid this movie do so at all costs. Hitchcock's 1940 version is so much better. I may be a die-hard Hitchcock fan but the Academy agrees with me. It won best picture and Olivier was nominated for his performance of Maxim. It's so much better than this monstrosity.",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"This film is not a so bad its good, it's a so bad the script doesn't warrant being used as recycled toilet paper bad. Having read rubbish reviews i thought the film can't be that bad. IT IS. It's obvious the film was made bad on purpose but it appears in it's attempts to be bad it overachieved and made it terrible. I love every film I've seen with dummy's or dolls but this one just didn't hit the bar and pales in comparison to The Leprechaun, that is a franchise so bad its good. This however could never ever hope to be held in the same regard as The Leprechaun, from the pitifully bad acting to the rubbish dummy it self the film fails in every quarter.<br /><br />Stay away from this film unless you love the worst films out there or this is going to be the first film you will ever watch because from here the only way is up and for the Triloquist I don't think it could get any lower.",Plot,,
"Before I start this review, I must admit that when I saw this movie, it was the wee hours of the morning and I was slightly intoxicated. Maybe my judgment was a little off, but I doubt it.<br /><br />'The Park' is a silly 3D horror movie about a haunted amusement park, which just happened to be built on a cemetery. After several deaths at the park, it was closed down. 14 years later, a journalist investigating the park goes missing (naturally). His sister, Yen, is determined to find him, but their mother, a ghost hunter, believes him to be dead already. Regardless of her mother's professional advice, Yen sets out with a group of ghost fodder (her friends) in an attempt to find her brother.<br /><br />Where to begin with this film's faults? There are so many. For starters, the plot is a mess. Unoriginal and full of plot holes. There is nothing close to horror in this. Sure, there are ghosts and other such dead people, but no scares. The 3D effects on which the film was based weren't all that impressive - or even 3D - on the VCD I watched. The dialog (in subtitles) was rather bad. All the characters seem to have a problem in which they felt the need to state the obvious, with everyone saying several times ""There are ghosts!"". I think they got the point after that was said for the billionth time.<br /><br />I will give 'The Park' credit for two things though: More proof that clowns are evil, and the fact that we have very little (to no) character development. It's a great way to determine early on who will die, and who will survive.<br /><br />After thinking about it, this seemed like it was meant to be campy B-movie. The (very blatant) references to 'Mr Vampire' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' prove that, but it still felt like the movie was taking itself too seriously. Sure, I laughed at some bad B-movie moments, but those few moments were surrounded by a whole lot of just plain bad material.<br /><br />1/10 - 'The Park' was very disappointing. Maybe I'll try watching it again sometime, but not any time soon.",Plot,Visual Effect,
"Man, what a movie. Pow! Zip! It's like an 18-act Italian opera taking place in the center ring of a three-ring circus while bears waltz and elephants stand on their heads on either side.<br /><br />Every camera trick known to man or beast is put to use. If Anna Batista (Argento), the famous actress, does a line of Special K, it's only to give the camera a chance to show us more phantasmagorical horrors in lurid color. The sink into which she tries to puke turns to rubber and so forth. And there's her mother's ghost.<br /><br />And it never stops. Well, not exactly. There are occasional pauses in the tumult while Anna and her friends seem to functioning normally, but the pauses are only there as lead-ins to the next bout of victimization.<br /><br />I lost count of the number of times Anna is roughly assaulted by men. The most memorable (because the funniest) is ""the finest writer-director in the world"" who summons her to Amsterdam. She's expecting to go over her script for Cleopatra but when she opens the door to his shabby multicolored garbage-strewn room she finds him lurching about, his pants unzipped, jerking in spasms, and managing to moan: ""I've been an alcoholic for four years -- and now I'm on SMACK."" The poor girl turns her head away in disgust while he shoots up. Then as he flops beside her on the couch and points out his new knife scar, she suggests they talk about the script. But the world's greatest writer-director has other things on his mind. He throws himself all over her, blubbering and pulling at her black slacks, while she squeals and manages to push him away. He calls her a woman of low repute, slaps her several times, and she rushes out the door.<br /><br />It must be some kind of female fantasy, or maybe it's just Asia Argento's thing, but the whole movie darts from one attempted rape to another. One is committed by some babe with surgically enhanced bosoms the size of basketballs. Another rape -- another rough one -- is attempted by some Hollywood producer of schlock films. He wears a curious beard but no underwear, and he sounds precisely like Dennis Miller.<br /><br />She has only one true love, an Australian rock singer of no distinctive talent. They meet and immediately go to bed. She winces when he crawls atop her and tells Keith that she's never made love before. ""Are you a virgin?"" ""No, I'm a whore."" That one-night stand with a man who turns out to have a wife and children was a dangerous one inasmuch as it impregnates her. On this discovery she runs big-bellied through the night-time streets of Rome until she collapses before a painting of the Virgin and Child. Her lost love appears in the distance, silhouetted by a halo of bright light -- so bright that she must blink when looking into it. It's left unclear whether she'll give birth to the next Messiah or the second Buddha. End of movie.<br /><br />It's a silly, low-budget piece of trash, and yet it doesn't diminish any respect I might have had for Asia Argento, the writer, director, and star. The writer and the director have thoroughly deglamorized the star. The DVD opens with Argento, sans makeup, looking wanly into the camera and telling us, ""I know you might have heard some bad things about this movie. But don't be afraid. After you watch it, maybe you will get to know me a little better -- and I will get to know you."" We get to know the character pretty well. For several minutes we watch her tattooed naked body before a bathroom mirror while she shaves her armpits, applies lipstick, and watches tears roll down her cheeks.<br /><br />The rape scenes are not at all erotic and Argento places the camera so that her body seems less like an object of desire than a dressed cabrito hanging in a butcher shop window. I mean, there is a brief shot of her bare ass as the slime ball Hollywood producer tries to pull her dress up and it the thought this undignified camera angle prompts is not how pretty her rear end is but how vulnerable the character, Anna Batista, is.<br /><br />The movie may or may not be very autobiographical, but in either case it's not a facile quest for pity from the audience. This bipolar dynamo can take care of herself. She lashes out hoarse, filthy curses at her tormentors in three different languages, a volcano of pejoration.<br /><br />I wish that energy and that disgust for artificiality had somehow been used as the engine for a better story. Or for any story at all. As it is, I think Argento was right when she said we might get to know her better. We wind up with more respect for her courage and sincerity.",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"Like the previous reviewer I read about ""Praise's"" appearance in our local art theatre (may have been the same showing) and came down to check it out. Like great writing, great film-making successfully journals the trials of everyday human conditions, rather than stringing together cinematic cliches. ""Praise"" accomplishes this as we immediately believe there are no actors, only we the audience feeling rather voyueristic and nodding with every move Gordon & Cynthia make as if we would have done the same. Unlike many directors, John Curran leaves much to his audience's judgement. I knew I'd watched the great telling of a great story, but also had a sincere appreciation for Curran's respect of our integrity as viewers. I'm left wondering why it took two years for ""Praise"" to reach Hollywood. Did someone in Australia put it in a bottle and throw it in the ocean toward the United States, drifting toward North America while we were plagued with ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Mission Impossible 2""?

"The movies plot itself is highly improbable, and there are a lot of factual errors, but do you want a documentary or do ya want to see a cool action movie featuring a butt kicking president played by the guy who did Han Solo? What we have here are some terrorist from Russia I think (why are terrorist from countries that don't actually have gripes with us in the movies) taking over air force one with president and family in tow. Of course, the president does not get captured, but instead eludes the terrorist and complicates matters for them as he frees some of the hostages and instead of leaving himself stays to get his family back. The movie seems to run a little long in places and there are a couple of pointless plot points (the whole Dean Stockwell character), overall though and mainly it is a cool action movie in the same vein as Die Hard or other movies where you have the one free guy making trouble for the bad guys. Speaking of bad guys, Gary Oldman is pretty good here as the head bad guy, so is most of the cast of this flick. Harrison Ford is usually good in anything so he fits right in here and makes for a very heroic albeit unrealistic president.",Plot,Performance,
"Before 'Another 48 Hours' was released, things were already in an uproar. Nick Nolte and others involved with the movie, vowed never to work with Eddie Murphy again. There were constant spats on the set with the biggest complaint that Murphy would arrive three hours late for filming while everyone would have to set around and wait for him to show up. If the above was true, Murphy is not the one to blame for the movies failure. 'Another 48 Hours' offers no surprises, originality and a ""plot"" that has been recycled over and over again.<br /><br />Co-written by the director of the first installment, Walter Hill, (who had years to come up with something good) gives the fans of the original a HUGE letdown. The opening scene has three bikers cruising all over the country blowing innocent people away and apparently they work for a major drug dealer known as Iceman that Jack Cates (Nick Nolte)has been trying to track down for years. The Iceman wants Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) dead for reasons that go unexplained throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />Cates job goes on the line when he kills a suspect who's gun cannot be found after the shooting. The suspect is burned to a crisp in a gasoline fire but the one important clue is unbelievably sparred.<br /><br />So Cate calls on Murphy to assist in saving the day and while the chemistry between the two was so good in the original '48 Hours,' something is now wrong. Nolte and Murphy don't seem to be enjoying themselves. They are not having fun. And either am I.<br /><br />The routine plot becomes more routine as the writers seem to know that the movie is not funny and try their best to distract the audience with endless car chases, shootouts, and the likes. One unintentional laugh I got was watching a bus roll over a dozen times at 50 miles an hour with Murphy in it but later seeing him walk away without a scratch. And the so called surprise when the identity of the Iceman is revealed is about as believable as Frosty The Snowman. (Perhaps the Iceman would be a better bad guy in Spider Man 3).<br /><br />Eddie, come back to us. We miss you.<br /><br />",Plot,,
"With the exception of the newly resurrected Full Moon movies, the Asylum distributes and produces the absolute worst horror movies on the video store shelves. The Asylum's legacy of lousiness continues with their Mummy epic, Legion of the Dead.<br /><br />This movie is basically like Queen of the Damned with mummies instead of vampires and with Bruce Boxleitner and the kid from Gremlins instead of Aaliyah. This tepid tale begins when a couple of dirt bikers stumble on an ancient Egyptian burial tomb somewhere in the mountains of Los Angeles. You heard me right, this ancient Egyptian burial chamber is in the foothills of Los Angeles. Somehow those wacky Egyptians managed to make it all the way to California with a bunch of their loot and sarcophagus with a Queen Mummy in it. The Gremlins kid (can't remember his name) is an archaeologist who is summoned to the site after the two dirt bikers tell the cops about what they found.<br /><br />The Gremlins guy leads a team on an expedition into the burial chamber. There's ten minutes of Indiana Jones shenanigans as our intrepid explorers make their way through into the tomb. Poisoned arrows, cryptic warnings written in hieroglyphs and trap doors abound. They make it through a winding maze of styrofoam cave walls and find a sarcophagus with an ancient Queen Mummy in it. Of course, they awaken this mummy from her slumber and it turns into an episode of Scooby Doo. The Queen Mummy reanimates a bunch of her mummy pals and they make short work of our explorers.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it doesn't get any more cookie cutter than this. It's shot on someone's camcorder, just like all the other offerings from the Asylum. The acting is cardboard. Overall, it's just a complete waste of time. My hope is that all lovers of horror movies will stop renting and buying these cheap, irritating movies from the Asylum. Maybe if they realize that they can't make a profit churning out these foul flicks, they will stop making them. I sure hope so.",Plot,Performance,
"I would recommend this movie to everyone to see. As a future history teacher I plan on incorporating this movie into my classes. I have studied the women's movement, and I have found the movie accurate and well told. It clearly depicts the hardships that women went through. It is a good reminder that their work isn't done. It is a good reminder that we must not rest on our laurels, but continue to stand up and fight for what we believe in. This movie had me going through so many different emotions, which is a rare quality of today's movies.<br /><br />As for the soundtrack, I thought it was appropriate for the movie. It helped bring even more emotion to the already eye-opening movie. It was a good choice of music.<br /><br />Congrats to all the actors and director for making such a wonderful movie.

"This is a wonderfully kooky and sexy film from MGM and director Tex Avery. Like his followup film, SWINGSHIFT Cinderella, this film features a very sexy red-headed female lead that looks like a combination of Betty Grable and Jessica Rabbit! Because of the overt sexuality of the cartoon, it isn't surprising that in 1943, this cartoon was banned or edited in several locales! Never before had such a hot cartoon leading lady been released by a major film studio and audiences of the day were both incensed and excited at the prospect! The cartoon begins with the traditional Red Riding Hood story. However, in rather typical Avery style, the characters step out of the tale and demand that this dull story be updated. So, moments later, Red Riding Hood is a living pin-up girl and the wolf is a sex-crazed ""wolf"" on the prowl for such a tasty dish! Like SWINGSHIFT Cinderella, however, the old lady (grandma in this case) is dead set on catching the wolf herself and does everything she can do to thwart the wolf from capturing Red. Most of the action is very high-paced and goofy--just like you'd hope in a Tex Avery cartoon.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great cartoon. While it isn't quite as funny as SWINGSHIFT, it is the first of its kind and because of that it still is one of the best of the era. My advice? See them both--though similar, you just can't get enough of these crazy cartoons and they abound with great humor and animation throughout. A true classic.",Plot,,

"The major themes of the movie are not so original as some people are lead to think. The fact that Kim Ki-Duk is Koreean and uses that environment is, of course,""exotic"" but this doesn't mean the movie has anything to say. I am puzzled as to the overall meaning implied here. From what I could understand the whole thing was about plastic surgery and how bad it is...unfortunately nothing more. There was a great potential in the idea, but it realization is simply preposterous. I don't necessarily ask for ""reality"" in a movie but in this case only something painfully real would have hit the spot. The plot devices are laughable, to name some of them, the death of the male character at the end, the use of the locations is unrealistic (especially the coffee shop). The actors don't seem to bother too much with being at least mildly pleasant and making the viewer interested in their problems. <br /><br />I heard the director had a few issues with Koreeans when he made this movie, because he is believed to portray his country in dark colors. Well, considering some of his early movies this is certainly so. Though it is not something inherently bad in doing this if you manage to convey the artistry you desire, I think that there are some things in Time which are pointless and through an unjustified shadow on Koreea. First of all the violence, utterly gratuitous, who could ever believe that people who react as they do in public spaces are left alone by the police? In this movie you have a doctor beating the living day-light out of a guy he was having a meeting with. And by the way, is it customary in Koreea for the doctors to break their ""vow of silence"" and share the details of their patients with whoever wants it? Aren't there laws against behavior such as this? Wouldn't a doctor loose his reputation, credentials and probably freedom if he attempted such a thing? And how about those telephone companies who erase your number in only a few minutes...?<br /><br />Most of Kim Ki-Duk's fans don't seem to be bothered by all these obvious flaws and think that a good idea makes a good movie. Some reviewers identified elements common to other movies, they are right. The plot is not based on original ideas. I always thought watching this at Hitchcock's Vertigo, identity change, betrayal, mistrust, obsessive love, trying to reach out to a person that's no longer there...no plastic surgery but, again, that's not meant to be the essential point here. What is present in Vertigo but lacks in Time is: suspense, good acting, clarity (Kim doesn't seem to give a damn about this aspect in none of his movies), and especially a coherent meaning for the whole picture. Any director is good if he manages to obtain his goals. This movie fails completely, instead of leaving me wandering what's wrong with today's society (which is a thing I don't have to be reminded by a movie anyway) it left me wandering what was wrong with the director. Is it something related to cultural differences? Then how come I like Kurosawa or Ozu so much? Sorry for not being useful...!",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"Although I'm always careful to avoid others' opinions before I see a film and make up my mind about it, I often look at what others have to say after I've reached a conclusion. I'm regularly flabbergasted by opinions on films such as Sixteen Tongues--which I thought was horrible--because they are often somewhat favorable. It especially confounds me in light of the consistently negative reviews received by films such as, say, Boogeyman (2005) or Gothika (2003), which I don't think are masterpieces, but they're well made. If reviewers are using anything even remotely resembling my criteria for film criticism, I have a difficult time understanding anyone thinking that a film like Sixteen Tongues is great while they also think that films like Boogeyman or Gothika are horrible.<br /><br />My current theory is that people are championing certain cultural facts. They're celebrating the simple existence of independent films made on extremely low budgets, which are marketed as being somewhat ""underground"", and in which filmmakers are trying to do something different artistically while they deal with at least some controversial subject matter. An attendant anti-""Hollywood"", anti-commercial, anti-big budget attitude tends to go hand in hand with the above.<br /><br />From my point of view, I'm critiquing the films only. I'm not critiquing any cultural facts, and I'm not giving any extra points or alternatively subtracting points for cultural situations that I'm in favor of or against, respectively. I think films should be viewed as if they exist in cultural vacuums. A movie is good or not only for what appears on your screen and comes out of your speakers. No other facts have a bearing on whether a film is good or not. Regardless of whether crap was produced for only ten dollars or ten million dollars, it's still crap. And Sixteen Tongues is crap.<br /><br />There are some potentially interesting things about the premise, on the ""forest"" level. The film is set in a post-apocalyptic future. The characters live in a run-down hotel/apartment building. They have to pay for water with their credit cards. They also have to pay to shut off the television, which otherwise continually plays porno commercials similar to those for 900 numbers that run at the beginning of porno VHS tapes. The government is now building robots, including prostitution robots, combat robots and so on. For some strange reason, an ability to surf the Internet is a rare skill in the film, so a character possessing the ability is depended on and looked up to. Most of these facts have to be pieced together by the viewer over the course of the film, and they all read 100 times more interesting than they play in the film.<br /><br />More pragmatically, Sixteen Tongues centers on three unattractive characters in two spartan settings. Although there is almost constant nudity, and there are a couple violent scenes, the vast majority of screen time is taken up with incessant talking and relatively inactive shots of these three characters while they provide narration. The story just isn't that interesting or well developed. The talking and narration are both very pretentious. And if they don't lean towards gobbledy-gook, they lean towards blandness.<br /><br />The male character, Adrian Torque (Crawford James), was killed during the last war and then brought back to life. He required skin grafts, and for some reason that either wasn't stated or was too garbled to understand (the sound mix is pretty bad, and characters tend to mumble and can't enunciate very well) the skin grafts were done with 16 tongues. From what I could tell, they were supposed to be human tongues, but they're sizeable enough and have characteristics more like giant lizard tongues. Maybe dinosaurs exist in the film's world. Supposedly the tongue grafts still work like tongues, as Torque says he can taste things through them. The idea is ridiculous and in a better film could have been campy and funny (it's too absurd to work seriously, which is the attempt here). It seems to just be an excuse for an easy way to use the title ""Sixteen Tongues"".<br /><br />The other two characters are Asian women who, despite being naked most of the time, are made to look as unattractive as possible. Ginny Chin-Chin's (Jane Chase) head has been shaven, which doesn't suit her, if it would suit any woman, and Alik Silens (Alice Liu) is made to look dorky--like those token male dweebs in teen comedies. It might seem like complaining about the women's attractiveness is trivial, but as the majority of the film is these two women rambling on and on in a hotel room with crappy production design and crappier cinematography, nudity is about the only possible attractor. Plus, Ginny, at least, is supposed to be sexy. Usually there's nothing I like more than seeing naked Asian women, but in this case, not really.<br /><br />For some, the attraction here is probably the ""daring"" subject matter. The nudity in the film is full frontal. There is simulated oral sex (on a male) and simulated hand manipulation (again on a male). The television keeps showing a crappily-filmed-but-graphic porno commercial, and the walls are papered with crappily-designed-(and too often repeated)-but-graphic porno advertisements. I'm a big fan of putting taboo-breaking material like this in films, but here, it doesn't work. It seems like director Scooter McCrae included it just because it's usually taboo. That's not sufficient to make a good film.<br /><br />I can't really think of a scene that wasn't poorly shot, poorly lit, poorly blocked and poorly set. I can't think of any aspect of the script that I liked. I can't think of any scene that even slightly drew me into the film. I can't think of any aspect of the performances I liked. I didn't get any aesthetic or philosophic value from the film. I've only given an extra point because the premise has a smidgen of potential and the film is somewhat coherent.",Plot,Directional Techniques,Performance

"Writer/Director Hilary Brougher has created a deeply involving and moving masterwork of film with her little independent low budget STEPHANIE DALEY. Brougher has courage to address an issue most people wish to submerge - that of unwanted teenage pregnancies and their consequences - and she does it in the form of a story that is so well woven and presented with such fine actors that she not only succeeds in bringing attention to her main topic, she also introduces us to two women whose lives, though separated by years of age, are significantly parallel. The result is a film that lingers in the mind long after the closing credits.<br /><br />Stephanie Daley (Amber Tamblyn) is a 16-year-old girl, shy, introverted and on the periphery of the social scene at high school until she meets a boy with whom she has consensual sex. The focus of her life changes as she grows in girth and at one dramatic point she gives birth to a fetus inside a bathroom stall which she secretly discards: no one knows Stephanie's secret. When she is examined, she is told she was pregnant, a fact which she denies. A forensic psychologist Lydie Crane (Tilda Swinton), pregnant herself, is brought into the case to examine Stephanie and help the court decide the truth about what happened. As Stephanie opens up to Lydie, Lydie begins to acknowledge her own conflicts about her current pregnancy with her husband Paul (Timothy Hutton): their first pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth and the current pregnancy began three months after that unresolved tragedy. When Lydie is not at her job she faces a world of people including a friend Frank (Denis O'Hare) who make her consider her own concepts of right and wrong. Lydie and Stephanie work together on the concept that 'the truth is what we believe'. How these two women reach the conclusions they do is the part of the story that is best left unshared until the viewer experiences it alone.<br /><br />The cast is so fine that to single out one would be a disservice to the ensemble effect director Brougher has achieved. Tilda Swinton continues to finesse her extraordinary gifts as an actress and the young Amber Tamblyn makes a significant stride for her career. There is a small role for fine character actress Novella Nelson as Doctor Lynn that is a remarkable achievement. This is a film with a tough subject matter, handled with the utmost dignity, and makes a social statement while glowing as a superb independent film. Highly recommended.

"I saw this film several times as a kid and really enjoyed it--seeing it as a 13 year old, it was my introduction to Steve McQueen. Watching it recently as an adult, I still find it amusing. As another reviewer said, it is Steve McQueen in self-deprecation mode. He is relaxed and amusing. And has some great one-liners. Example--<br /><br />LeVar Burton: ""What's that, Papa?"" Steve McQueen: ""Stun gun."" LeVar Burton: ""What does it do?"" McQueen: ""Ruin your day.""<br /><br />McQueen is almost child-like in this movie. The way he interacts with Kathryn Harold, and the thugs he goes after. But he's still the McQueen we know and love when he confronts the Texas ranger played by Ben Johnson. See this movie--it's got some great humor and stunts. The music is a bit cheesy and the story is rather episodic, but still a fun night at the movies.",Plot,Music,
"Not only do the storylines in ""The Sopranos"" engage audiences from all over, but I think (for me at least) what brings the viewers back is the acting. (Not even you, Gary, can dispute that claim) James Gandolfini, who plays the lead-man, Tony Soprano, has become (in this viewer's opinion) one of the ""Hollywood Elites"" as far as acting in a television series goes. I wouldn't go ahead and compare him with Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino, or at least, not just yet. He, however, does do a hell of a job playing the part of Tony Soprano. In the years since 1999, Gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor (mainly thanks to his role in The Sopranos) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business. And it's not just him. ""The Sopranos"" fields a great supporting cast including that of Lorraine Bracco, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Dominic Chianese, and the late Nancy Marchand who played Tony's dreadful mother. At this point in the show's existence, it's being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so. The first two seasons were extraordinary. Violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner, but without a doubt, extraordinarily done. The third season was great, but didn't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2. Season 4, which wrapped up right before new-years, was the weakest season yet (or at least, in my opinion it was). Despite a dry-spell, I still found it (season 4 of ""The Sopranos"") to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that's saying a lot because lately I've been noticing a trend in good new television shows. Examples of this: Six Feet Under, The Shield, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and OZ (which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year). To get back to my point though, to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year, no less, is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers. ""The Sopranos"" ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit. To close, I'd like to say, ""The Sopranos"" is the real deal folks. For the average mature viewer (17 and above) who enjoys drama and doesn't mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity, you might want to check out ""The Sopranos"" if you get the chance. Trust me in that it will be well worth the time.",Plot,Others,

Let me just say that someone had a fetiche for female facial hair in this movie. It's also cruel to a step beyond the first two--Brandon Lee grieved, Vincent Perez went masochist, but William Atherton smiles like a killer clown.

If you make a movie about two incredibly boring people, you're going to end up with an incredibly boring movie. Somehow this didn't occur to those who chose to inflict this turkey on the viewing public.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the ups and downs in the romantic relationship between Danny (Rob Lowe) and Debbie (Demi Moore). Demi spends a lot of her time crying and looking wounded. So does Lowe, except that he also does a fine job of looking bored while he's making this dud. (At least he's honest!) James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins seem to have been added to the cast to provide some comedy relief. That would have been welcome, except that neither one of them was very funny. Their performances as the best friends of Danny and Debbie who get consumed by jealousy starts to grate after about 15 minutes. However, in fairness, it was them who kept me watching. Two or three times there were hints that these two polar opposite characters might have a romance of their own beginning to bud, and I really wanted to see if it happened. That was the only thing that raised this movie from a 2 to a 4. Watching Demi and Rob was about as exciting as watching ice cubes melt.",Plot,Performance,
"Regarded as a classic by most people simply because it is Alfred Hitchcock's first suspense film. Unfortunately, The Lodger is almost completely bereft of the fine craftsmanship that would come to be Hitchcock's calling card in his later films. Inspired by the Jack the Ripper murders, the story centers on a family who takes in a mysterious young man amidst a series of killings going on in the city. Unengaging and slow moving, the film drags on as the family begins to suspect the young man of being the killer. Their suspense builds, but ours does not. The film picks up nicely in the last twenty minutes with a couple of plot twists and a jealous boyfriend / detective, but it's not quite enough to save the film. There are also a couple of examples of artistic cinematography and symbolic imagery, but it never really pays off. Hitchcock's best work was still well ahead of him.",Plot,,

Well, Air Force One(1997) is a lousy feature compared to that scifi classic. Gary Oldman is average as the main villain. One reason I hate this movie is its Hollywood by the numbers approach and lack of any compelling characters.<br /><br />It seems that Harrison Ford is trying to be John Wayne in his actions and this is the film's fatal mistake. The role of the President was originally written for Kevin Costner who instead choose to do The Postman(1997). I depised Air Force One(1997) so much that I was rooting for the villains to succeed. Air Force One is a disgrace from a compatent director like Wolfgang Petersen who did better things like Das Boot(1981), The Neverending Story(1984), and In the Line of Fire(1993).

The concept of people from thousands of years ago being killed and buried in the bogs was interesting. Them reanimating just out of the blue and seeking out a specific kind of person, that's a little iffy. Also the fact that all of these people just happen to converge on this same cottage on the same day is just too much coincidence as is not having phone service when they were apparently only about three miles from a road. I did not like the little love connection they felt needed to be in the movie. It added nothing to the story. This is in no way a horror movie. It is more something that is based on a false lore that has been told for years. Seeing Vinnie Jones was it's only redeeming feature.",Plot,,
"In my 1001 movies you must see before you die book, this documentary was actually recommended. Not to mention that when I saw the movie Monster, that won Charlize Theron her Oscar, I was more interested in learning about Aileen Wuornos, one of the country's first female serial killers. My mom and I have been watching this show called Most Evil or something like that and Aileen gets mentioned quite a bit, she's up there with most male serial killers on how she thought and acted. So I rented this movie curious on her interviews and what she was like before her execution, man, this woman was disturbed, very badly.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this documentary is that it seemed like Nick was a hypocrite saying how everyone was trying to make money off of her, but he did just that by making this documentary. Not to mention that I don't like the fact that he tried to make her sympathetic, I'm sorry, just she did still kill these men. There was only proof that the first killing was a possible self defense, but the rest were just out of blind robbery. I know there are a lot of sick people out there, I don't think she did it for pleasure, but still acting upon what she did was just wrong.<br /><br />Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer is a good documentary, don't get me wrong, this was still incredible and I'm glad that he was able to get these interviews with Aileen. I couldn't believe her last interview, it seemed like she had lost her mind. The only thing that made me feel sorry for her is how long she had to wait for death row, it's like 12 years of torture, but I'm tossed up on the decision of death row. It's a tough subject. But this was a good documentary on her life and what might have led Aileen to act the way she acted. Aileen killed 7 men, lived as a man hating lesbian, a hitch hiking hooker; did society make her this way or did she just not see the light?

"I saw this mini series a couple of years ago after searching on the internet and found this film adaptation from Canada (I live in England) and I though 'great' so I bittor... err... obtained a copy and watched it all - I'm not sure how - in abject horror.<br /><br />Now there are numerous comments here - the majority in fact - which will tell your if you even got to reading THIS review, why it invokes such horror. Now I'm not a fan of Le Guinn, I've only read the first 'Wizard' book, not even the series. It follows a young wizard called Sparrowhawk through his life's trials as he sails around earthsea, a fictitious archipelago from ages old. It's a fairly straightforward story. However, it's such an extraordinarily exquisite and authentic experience it's emotional simply through the quality of the composition of the narrative itself, story content aside. I'm not an obsessed fan, I just know when something is really good, and this TV production ON ITS OWN was the typical trash you see on TV every day (except I quit watching TV in 1999 so I don't have to suffer) - in that sense it's fairly normal, and OK production. But in comparison to the story it's allegedly based on it's such an immense, indescribably travesty that, - well, I can't describe it. It should never have been made. They should have made a film of some talented unknown young (or old) fantasy writer in Canada instead.<br /><br />Why should this matter? It doesn't really does it. However as one previous reviewer said, quite rightly: ""...its almost impossible for filmmakers to make a movie about a loved book without disappointing their fans."" I have to disagree with other texts in this 'genre' however - Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Narnia - all clearly with staggering budgets of course and various contract obligations obviously in the case of the irritating though opportunistic and hard working Rowling. They did stick verbatim to the story lines.<br /><br />Anyway I don't have time to slate this really, I'm only reviewing it to give it the one star it doesn't even deserve to take the average rating down, it's much too high because of all these people who don't know any better reviewing it without having knowledge of the book. I know, it's anal, in any other case I'd really not bother, Rowling, CS Lewis (the g@y tw@t, I wish his publisher had sacked him) Pullman, even Tolkein, any book, I don't really care, I'd enjoy the book, and/or enjoy the film, or not. However there's something kinda special about this book - not spectacular, just really tight storytelling. Well you can read it and find out. This TV adaptation is agonising.<br /><br />My main beef is that, Lord of the Rings aside (obviously) This book, A Wizard of Earthsea, is the most worthy of making into a really long, really expensive film - more than anything by CS Lewis or Rowling (she seems to have taken the main premise of her Potter books FROM Wizard of Earthsea in fact, the magicians school.<br /><br />Rant over.

In the 90's, when I watched this movie for the first time, I was very impressed with such a tight screenplay and outstanding performances of the cast, and I decided to ""recheck"" my first impression. Indeed it is a great low budget thriller, almost theatrical and having a story with no flaws. Bruce Willis has a very different participation, in the role of a disgusting drug addicted, and proves that he is a good actor. Harvey Keitel in the role of an astute detective, finding the controversies in the testimony of Cynthia, is amazing. Demi Moore has also an inspired acting, in the role of a mother in a dilemma between telling a secret and hiding the truth. And Glenne Headly is also great, in the role of an abused and very unsecured low class woman. Even seeing this movie for the second time, it is very worthwhile and recommended.

It's a surprisingly bleak and sometimes vicious study of British resilience, light years away from the dull Hollywood sentimentality of ""Mrs Miniver"". It's about a group of Fifth Columnists who take over a small British village in 1942 in preparation for the German invasion and of how the villagers fight back.<br /><br />It has all the usual stereotypical villagers, (the post-mistress, the squire etc), but these clichéd parts are turned on their heads with surprisingly suspenseful results.

Why does the robot-wench at the end (who Richard Benjamin thinks is real) short out when he gives her water, yet the Yul Brenner robot-gunslinger character (among other robots)can pour whiskey down their mouths? Hmmm. Okay, and I'll buy the ""pistols have sensors in them so the guests won't get killed"" thing, but there are swords and maces in Medieval World. What, when a violent enemy swings a mace at your head, it has a ""sensor"" to stop it in mid-air just short of splattering your head?

I guess you could make some argument that this is some sort of ""meta-thematic"" cultural commentary about the authentic West vis-a-vis our conception of it as transmitted to us by Hollywood.

"MASTER PLAN: get the death ray plans from a kidnapped scientist. Yet another in a long line of European James Bond knock offs during the swinging sixties, this piqued my curiosity due to the casting of Gordon Scott as the super agent - meet Bart Fargo! I was mostly familiar with Scott for his Tarzan portrayals of several years earlier, some of which were quite good; of course, he is also well known for his roles in Italian musclemen epics, playing mythical heroes named Goliath or Maciste. So, he has no problem depicting the physical aspect of being a hero - you have no trouble believing he can beat up a couple of henchmen. In fact, most of the entertainment value here stems from a wry sensibility developing by the time Scott is thrashing his 4th or 5th thug (Fargo is the target of several killers during the movie). By that 4th time, Fargo is barely trying - he merely taps a door into the bad guy and then starts slapping him around like a wet noodle. I thought, this is what happens when Goliath puts on a suit and pretends to be a secret agent. This was one of Scott's last leading roles after a career of over a decade and it's actually a shame he didn't get to do more of these, improving on the formula.<br /><br />The plot begins with the kidnapping of a scientist - much gunplay and cars moving in the night. Fargo isn't introduced until a good 20 minutes in, awoken from his beauty sleep by a couple of babes. He has the now-familiar repartee with this film's version of M and Ms. Moneypenny - it's blatantly derivative. The problem with Italian pics such as these (such as ""OK Connery"" aka ""Operation Double 007"") is the dubbing; the voice actors obfuscate the speech patterns and you're guessing what Scott's performance was really like. The spoken dialog itself is terribly crude: a woman is painting some self-portrait and Fargo climbs into her apartment thru the roof; 'What's the matter?' she says. 'Haven't you ever seen an artist's studio?' This passes for sophisticated spy seduction talk here. Later, Fargo interrogates one of his attackers. 'Awright, talk!' Fargo demands, pointing his silencer. 'If I tell ya, the boss'll have me killed,' the guy answers, 'please try to understand!' Then, Fargo pauses and growls 'Listen, you tell me or you're gonna be in REAL trouble.' What's Fargo's threat? Kill the guy even more? Finally, the FX - oh, oh. Fargo is forced off the road at one point in his red European sportscar, falling off a cliff into the sea; only, it's obviously a tiny model car falling into a pond. I laughed out loud yet, at the same time, admired the filmmakers' audacity. They're telling the audience, hey, this is what you get; you don't like it, sue us.

But once Hickman is in the middle of it all, he realizes his wife is what is most important to him and he sets the works in motion to woo her away from Rudolph Valentino. The formula makes for some of the best heart-warming entertainment that's hit the big screen. It's endearing and funny in its bittersweet malaise.<br /><br />It also goes a long way towards showing what CAN be done with no effects and no locations beyond the Studio Backlot and a few, cheap but decent sets.<br /><br />While it is frayed about the edges, this classic favorite is one ripe for a DVD restoration...perhaps even a 2-disk director's cut for those of us fans who have BEEN fans since the beginning.<br /><br />It rates an 8.8/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.",Plot,,
"If ever I have seen a worse movie, I can't remember it. While browsing around a Video Store one day, my girlfriend picked this up out of the<br /><br />bargain bin for about five bucks because she said that it looked like<br /><br />it would be interesting and how could you go wrong for five dollars etc. All very well and good I suppose....but less than half an hour into this mess my girlfriend could stand it no more, and I had to literally force myself to sit there and watch this train wreck of a<br /><br />movie. I would tell you about the acting, but there is no acting in this film....it's like watching pictures on a post card. I would tell you about the plot....but if I could do that, it would mean that I made sense out of this mess and would definitely be in need of some real help! There is no redeeming qualities in this film, and if you see it in the bargain bin on DVD, take it up to the clerk, chastise them for improper labeling, then have the clerk stick a Frisbee sticker on it.<br /><br />",Plot,Performance,
"This is Izo:<br /><br />Izo is about a character who represents the unacceptable in society. The good and the bad parts simultaneously: He is the progressive spirit that rains righteous wrath upon the corruption in religion, government and the world of finance, freeing man from oppressive rulers. And he is the barbarism of which the human animal is capable when running unchecked and uncontrolled; unrestrained. He represents these aspects of the human spirit up through history, and must finally end his existence when man has attained the purity to cast off oppression for good and eradicate his own barbaric tendencies through moral discipline and self-control. Izo is humanity's anger, righteous and frustrated; resolute and indignant, leading us towards utopia while cutting a swath through the sadly ignorant masses that would oppose him.<br /><br />Izo is a movie loaded with symbolism, and every drop of blood is artistically justified. Even so, it is nowhere near as clear as it could have been, and the entertainment value is merely so-so. Generally a cool movie, not overly pleasant, but certainly a radical artistic statement of solid integrity.<br /><br />My rating: 8 out of 10.",Plot,,
"Whoever claimed ""The Two Mrs Carrolls"" was Bogie at his worst in terms of movie making is nuts; Bogie's worst film is either ""Swing Your Lady"" or ""The Return of Doctor X."" Them films were horrid and I can barely sit through them.. I found ""Carrolls"" quite interesting and somewhat freaky...<br /><br />I do admit, as far as explaining Bogie's character (Geofrey Carroll) with being mentally ill, the story is vague there... Their really is no reason or explanation as to why he tires of his wife / wives and decides to kill them off one by one after painting a morbid portrait of them....<br /><br />Anyway, regardless of what critics think of this film effort from 1947, I think Bogie, Stanwyck, Alexis Smith and Nigel Bruce made a good cast and crew... Even the young Ann Carter was good as Bogie's daughter 'Beatrice' in the movie....<br /><br />I have noticed that the excellent network TCM rarely ever shows this picture...... I myself had to wait for over a year to finally record and obtain it for my collection here recently.... I rate the film a 7 out of a possible 10 points......

"This was nice, harmless fun for the most part. I got turned off right near the beginning of the film when the alien couple got a motel room and the wife was seen laughing out loud as she read the Bible: a typical Hollywood cheap shot.<br /><br />After that, however, it was fine and had some funny, outrageous scenes. However, I would definitely not call this movie ""hilarious"" as I had heard it described a number of times. I wouldn't get that carried away. However, it was decidedly entertaining all the way through, never boring and pretty tame profanity-wise. There were a number of sex remarks and innuendos, maybe to make up for the little profanity but by today's standards this was an inoffensive film.<br /><br />It's an hour-and-a-half of goofy humor played by the same people (Dan Achroyd, Jane Curtin, etc.) who made this couple famous on television.",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"I saw this movie a few months ago at a preview at the London offices of Channel 4 - the director was there. the movie is a very witty look at the nature of modern media - using the ubiquitous presence of a TV chef who now finds his career on the slide - as the focal point. It blends this with a ""heist gone wrong"" scenario - all of which takes place during a dinner party - and a subsequent series of meals. As they eat, the characters find themselves shifting roles - those under siege take over the siege, those who staged the siege want out - and everyone wants to exploit their 15 minutes of fame. It's a clever black comedy - almost a British Woody Allen picture (his later period!) - well acted by a strong cast. It made me laugh - it made me think - and more than anything - it made me recognise. Recommemnded.",Visual Effect,Performance,Directional Techniques

You see very good-looking people, enjoying their lives fully, stereotypically named (Adam & Eva), a newly remodeled house that looks like it had been in use for months at least... The problems in this movie are no real problems, everything is easy and at the end we choose between some paradisiacal island and an idyllic home. This movie looked like one of those 'Better living at home' magazines to me. Everything is sooo very pleasant and tasteful. <br /><br />Daniel Auteuil seems to be the only one who realizes he is totally out of place, but he can't find a way out from the set.

"If there were an award for the most amount of stock footage in a film, this would have to win. The producers probably shot only about 10-15 minutes of extra scenes and spliced them into an hour of stock footage from several different films. Over the stock footage there is a narrator trying to connect the whole mess together. The so called native people shift from white to Asian to black randomly from scene to scene. The special effects (???) are awful and the pop tart, I mean devil monster, only appears long enough to eat some guys arm. The scene where the guy is fighting the monster is clearly superimposed as you can see the water in one part showing right through the other part making the guy in the water look transparent.",Visual Effect,Directional Techniques,
"This movie is visually beautiful, the character design catching the atmosphere of the first manga's of Osama Tezuka-san (they remind me of early Disney animations as well...) The backgrounds are done in CGI. Still, they fit in nicely with the characters. The music is jazzy/ dixieland-ish as should be for the era that this film is supposed to honor. OK, so much for the good stuff. I'm thoroughly disappointed on the absence of any character development besides the obvious difference between evil/ good. The only one who get's some development is the detective. The rest stays as flat as the paper that pulp is written on, not the paper of a decent manga, mind you. The story does not convince me. I cannot relate emotionally to any of the characters.<br /><br />If you want some good anime on comparison between robots and humans, go see: Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (Romaji: Inosensu: Kôkaku kidôtai) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347246/",Visual Effect,Music,Plot
"A newspaperman (Johnny Twennies) living in the 90's with a complete 20's personality and lifestyle - fedora, manual typewriter, the Charleston, the works. It's a great idea for a movie and it couldn't have been done better.<br /><br />Johnny doesn't miss a cliche, but never uses the same one twice. You'll find yourself anticipating his reactions to the harsher '90s world as the movie goes along, you'll often guess right - but that makes the movie just that much more fun.<br /><br />Lots of fun when Johnny is called on to save the same damsel in distress (named Virginia, natch) on three different occasions. She responds with appropriate fluttering eyelids each time.<br /><br />His reaction to independent women, openly gay men, and the general '90s milieu is delightful. He remains happily oblivious.<br /><br />Don't worry, the movie never takes itself seriously. Nobody preaches about the evil of the present, or the shallowness of the past. You end up with a warm feeling for all the characters, even the bad guys. This was one of those rare movies where you can actually feel that the performers are thoroughly enjoying their characters. The film makers make sure you know that with a delightfully offbeat ending.<br /><br />",Plot,Performance,Others

Genius idea. So many times I've been stuck watching a movie like Star Wars and thought, jeesh, this movie is great, but it could do with a few Star Trek cut aways.<br /><br />There are moments of true hilarity and you have to admire the balls it takes to put a film like this out there<br /><br />Bravo, no, really, BRAVO.",Others,Others,Others
"Very good film from director Wyler, although it is its star, Bette Davis, upon whom its high quality mostly rests. This is perhaps Davis' best performance that I've seen. She plays a spoiled Southern belle whose fiancé (Henry Fonda) leaves her after a socially embarrassing event. As he leaves her, she swears that he will return, as he has in the past. And he does, one year later, with his new Northern wife in tow. The film does wonders with its historical setting, New Orleans a short while before the Civil War. A year before Gone with the Wind cooed over the fancy lives and manners of the Ante Bellum South, Jezebel was exploring them in more detail, and with a more intelligent eye. Also lurking about is the threat of Yellow Fever, which devastated New Orleans in the 1830s and is starting to grow rampant again. Another thing I really liked about Jezebel was its ending. Perhaps when it was released in 1938 there would be a feeling that Davis' character has turned a corner and has become more selfless, but to me her motives seemed awfully suspicious. That ambiguity is fascinating. Along with the leads, Donald Crisp and George Brent give fine supporting performances, and Max Steiner's score is one of the best of its era. 9/10.",Plot,Performance,Others
"This flick will pass the time, and Kurt Russle is always interesting to watch, but JEEEZ is this one clichéd. Every standard suspense element is there:<br /><br />1: Several scenes where you think the killer is coming, big scary music, then it turns out to be someone else. Ooooh, I'm soooo scared!<br /><br />(spoilers ahead, I guess)<br /><br />2: the good guys girlfriend ends up s the final target. gee, never woulda' thought of THAT....<br /><br />3: Oh heck, why waste time listing them all. I have already taken more time with this review than the production team took making the movie.<br /><br />The score is absolutely hilarious. It goes from nothing, to Hitchcock-on-steroids about fifty times. Might as well have a narrator shouting ""here comes something scary! hear comes something scary!""<br /><br />Russel and Garcia manage to come off OK despite the hackneyed script. However, Mariel Hemmingway makes a fool of herself with her overacting in the end. Well, at least she shows her tits in the requisite, early shower scene (gotta' get that ""R"" rating, after all.) Big woop.<br /><br />I can't say I'm surprised that Phillip Borsos only directed two more films after this one.<br /><br />Don't go out of your way to watch this, though as I said, it WILL pass the time.

"The Feeding is a terrible werewolf movie about a group of campers who begin getting killed off by a lycanthrope running loose in the woods. Two cops are sent in to bring down the beast as it continues with it's feast (no this is not a poem). The plot for this is identical to many other mindless, cheezy micro-budget monstrosities and all of the actors look as if they are reading their lines off signs a crew member is holding up behind the camera. It also contains a very cliché moment in which two characters want to discuss a personal matter while trying to survive. The werewolf costume is laughably stupid looking and seems to be constantly drooling. Plus it's facial features never move. Just stay far, far away from this atrocious movie.",Plot,Performance,Others
"Here is another of those films that got panned by critics all over the place, but I liked the movie and thought it was unfairly criticized.<br /><br />Two things are not up for debate: the film is entertaining and the cinematography is gorgeous.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio's lead character is not particularly likable, but that's nothing new for him. He's good at playing the boyish, cocky immature type. He's also good at narration, which he provides here, as he has in a number of other films. In fact, I wish there were more of it in here.<br /><br />French actress Virginie Ledoyen is a new face to me, and a pretty one. I found her intriguing, and not just because of her face Actually, all the characters were pretty darn interesting in this film and you get a varied group.<br /><br />The scenery from Thailand is magnificent. By the way, ""the beach"" that's in this film really exists, just as it's seen here. The story is interesting, too, for the full two hours. My only complaint was that they might have toned down the language, particularly with all the f-words.<br /><br />Don't listen to those national critics who blasted this.

"Not sure how a filmmaker as prolific as Joel ""Lost Boys"" Schumacher could make his return, in essence, to the vampire horror subgenre only to find his finished product, ""Blood Creek,"" tossed into second-run theaters in a handful of locations with virtually no heads up to the popluace. (As of this writing, the IMDb listing is still ""Town Creek,"" and not ""Blood Creek."") Lionsgate apparently thought they had a marketing nightmare on their hands... which may indeed be the case.<br /><br />This imperfect yet original thriller deals with such batshit insane subject matter as undead Nazis, demonic horses, Viking runestones, suits of bone armor, human sacrifice, and the beginning of an occult war that Germany began back in the 1930s. So okay, perhaps it's easy to see, at least on the surface, why this might have been a hard sell. It's just too bad most horror fans won't get a chance to see this one-of-a-kind original in the wake of so many remakes, reboots, and sequels. At least somebody had their thinking cap on when conceiving this thing... or at the very least were taking some heavy duty crazy pills. I mean, did I mention that a Nazi ""vampire"" (for lack of a better word) possesses a horse that nearly kills our protagonists like some kind of man-eating beast? Or that he later hammers a hole in his forehead before tearing off his face and growing a third eye? WTF?!<br /><br />True, ""Blood Creek"" isn't for everyone, which probably explains why it will find its audience primarily on the DVD circuit even had its release not been as top secret as Germany's occult activities during WWII. The concept is so insane, so bereft of screaming teenagers, so utterly lacking in irony despite the absolute insanity splashed upon the screen, it's bound to turn a lot of viewers off. To make matters worse, a tedious black and white prologue complete with unnecessary voice-over stains the beginning of the film, hinting too much at the later goings-on when it would have been more fun to learn the truth as the film surges forward. This seems like a studio afterthought, tacked on gracelessly before an otherwise inspired and fast-moving siege flick.<br /><br />If you want a fresh take on ""vampires"" and aren't yet tired of evil Germans circa 2009, this promotionless horror flick should fit the bill despite its issues. Once the pace kicks up, it never relents, and the mythology it creates is interesting albeit completely daft. What's here certainly falls into the ""Night of the Living Dead"" formula (a house under siege by supernatural forces), but with an off-the-reservation twist. Check it out... if you can find it.",Plot,Others,Others

"I was initially hesitant about watching Amu because movies with a backdrop of communal riots don't sit well with me. However, I had heard good things about the film and for that reason I also did not want to miss it.<br /><br />Amu is a film about a young, adopted girl on a quest to find her birth parents. Kaju, played by Konkona Sen Sharma, lives in LA and is visiting India to be with her mother's family. During her visit she is also trying to get more information about her real parents, who she knows nothing about. The journey to find out her identity has her come across the characters played by Yashpal Sharma and Ankur Khanna, who help take her to each lead and finally to a point where she discovers her history. A history that is tied to the 1984 communal riots. <br /><br />Amu is also about Kaju's relationship with her mother who is trying to keep the truth from her.<br /><br />Shonali Bose does a fabulous job in telling the story and keeping the viewer glued to the screen. The cast was obviously selected very carefully. Konkona is completely believable as the young NRI. Brinda Karat as the mother puts in a wonderful performance, besides looking gorgeous! Ankur Khanna is perfect as the brooding, cynical Kabir, who gets exposed to a life he is completely unfamiliar with. Yashpal Sharma makes you laugh and makes you cry. The Bengali family as well as Kabir's parents are all people most Indians would have come across.<br /><br />In conclusion all I have to say is that Amu rocks!

Whenever a character develops in an episode, all the progress is forgotten once you get to the next one. Eliza gives bird a needle so it could gather insects more efficiently, thus unleashing a domino effect which quickly harms the environment. So, she realizes that she shouldn't go about doing things without thinking of consequences. Lesson learned. No. She proceeds to do something stupid again after that, completely ignoring what she has learned. Also, she's completely arrogant and probably more than half of the situations she gets into wouldn't even occur if the little brat would have bothered to let the person/animal complete their sentence! This point alone makes the show extremely unbearable.<br /><br />Debbie goes through the show as the big, mean and selfish sister. She get's a job in Siberia and learns about being kind to others.

"It's hard to say with some Asian flicks whether they were made to be serious or if they were made as spoofs. If this one was made to be serious, it's also an excellent spoof. The story is not that much different from that of King Kong, except home base is Hong Kong & the Peking Man has been spotted in the Himilayas, so a heart-broken explorer and a team of men head off to find it. Our heart-broken explorer had just caught his fiancée in bed with a friend and therefore was ready for anything to get out of town, but maybe this...he finds the Mighty Peking Man but he also finds Ah Wei, a beautiful blonde who wears a ragged loincloth and top, who can communicate with Peking Man & also all the other animals in the jungle, except for perhaps a cobra, which bites her. Seems like she was in a plane crash with her parents years ago & they died but she lived with the animals. After bidding a tearful farewell to her favorite leopard (which is shown making choked-up faces when she walks away) she sets sail for Hong Kong with Mighty Peking Man chained to the deck of the ship, and from then out out it's more or less like ""King Kong"" only funnier. There's the obligatory shoot-out on a tall building at the end, and the usual treachery from those who don't understand. Strange that Ah Wei communicates with Kong in ""native language"" in the jungle but then in English towards the end, maybe he's as fast a learner as she is. Some of the earlier parts of this film are beautifully done, and somewhat fun and exhilarating, but it bogs down a bit toward the end with the seemingly endless shoot-out. There's some truly priceless bits in this, like someone getting their leg bitten off by a tiger near the beginning, and a gun battle with rear-projected elephants, and so on.

"I am a huge fan of the original National Lampoon articles about O.C and Stiggs, and sadly, this movie captures little of the glory of those stories. Still, there are a few good moments, such as when King Sunny Ade and his African Beats are playing, and also when they show any exterior shot (the movie was filmed around Mesa and Phoenix, AZ). Also, I still remember the primal screams of ""SCHWAAAAAAAAAB!!"" when I think of this movie. The torture the Schwab family endures will most always bring a smile to my face. I think the biggest problems with this movie lie in the fact that the original O.C. and Stiggs articles were very 'out-there', some of the concepts were not P.C. for even then in the late 80s. One article related how they put a hayride together and made all the mentally challenged kids at one school ride in it, and how OC & S each got oral sex from one of the kids. This kinda storyline does not make a movie producer automatically start scrambling for the checkbook. So these non-PC (frankly, audience-scaring) ideas had to be 'toned down', to the point where the producers lost the core audience they were shooting for in the first place. Another area that needed work was the plot. It's pretty thin, even for this type of movie. The boys want King Sunny Ade to play a concert in town, so they do what they can to make it happen (Let's put on a bake sale!). That's it. As blah as this movie was, I still recommend it if only for the music. I can't wait until it finally comes out on DVD.",Plot,Music,Others

As stated before, the casting of the particular actors and actresses in TRACKS to play 14-16 year olds makes no sense, and even worse, detracts from the film; they're just way too old to play the parts called for. But even if that's a forgivable faux pas, the truth is, at times, this film was just so plain boring that I considered not bothering to see it through to the finish...

Now that the dealers think Levy is the buyer, Jackson has no choice but to work with Levy to bust the ring.<br /><br />Like I said, the plot if mediocre. But the movie itself is good. Jackson walks the walks, and Levy talks, talks, and talks!

I was so intrigued with the story line I wanted to see the ending but again because of the scrip and acting I could only watch it in small doses.

Not because he's a relentless one-man killing squad, of course, but because he's the living proof that you can still chase your dreams and realize your ambitions even if you're physically disabled Yeah right, enough with this rubbish! ""The Amazing Mr. No Legs"" is a totally demented  in idea as well as execution  exploitation feature with a premise that is unique and refreshing and production values looking so cheap and amateurish that you simply have to show admiration for the cast and crew.

When the sister of a dedicated cop gets killed in a drug execution it means the start of a devastating war between the good cops, the bad drug dealsand everyone in between. The script is surprisingly convoluted and well written, but those are not the main reasons why this film will stick to your memory. It has girl-on-girl bar fights, wild shootouts, bad acting, sword fights, odd cars and virulent chases and much more. ""The Amazing Mr. No Legs"" is extremely violent, but never actually shocking since the effects and stunts aren't exactly convincing. Some people might take offense upon seeing the fighting sequences involving the handicapped lead character, but then again, I don't suppose easily offended people are likely to put ""Mr. No Legs"" on their Christmas list. The slow-motion sequence where actor Ted Vollrath demonstrates his genuine martial arts skills is literally jaw-dropping. Ever seen a guy with no legs kick someone repeatedly in the stomach? No legs!! The titular ought to be considered as one of the greatest cult icons ever: a truly menacing, bad to the bone and self-reliable villain. ""Mr. No Legs"" is not an easy movie to come across, but definitely worth the search.",Performance,Visual Effect,Plot
"The fact is, Who's That Knocking at My Door put Martin Scorsese on the map. Sure his big breakthrough was with Mean Streets (look at the tagline), but this film is a stunner for which Scorsese deserves (and gets) big props. The film has a typical Italian-American guy named JR (Harvey Keitel, also his first film along with Scorsese's) who falls in love with a nice girl (Zina Bethune), and the film shows they're relationship, while JR hangs with his friends, contemplating his life. Simple plot which actually gets tangled sometimes, but this if the only minor flaw this film has.<br /><br />It is a triumph of style over substance, though the substance comes damn near close to the style of Scorsese's direction that is later seen in his other triumphs (you get the feeling you've seen every type of shot before in this film if you've seen other Scorsese pictures). A must see. Extra note: in the scenes with sex and violence (crude for that time, but still a little suggestive) have little or no sound of the people actually saying anything; music takes over the scene just like in Mean Streets, GoodFellas and Casino (by the way, the sex scene is one of the most exhilarating scenes I've seen in a movie).

"Bristling with intellectual playfulness, this worthy homage to one of America's favorite systematic stumpers, the daily New York Times' crossword puzzle, first starts out as a witty documentary on the history of this fixation but eventually evolves into so much more. Beginning with an analysis and introduction into the rarely discussed guilty pleasure, Wordplay evolves it's purpose as the film moves along, initiating the viewer into the lives of these often brilliant and eccentric people who revolve around the cerebral workout NY Times puzzle editor Will Shortz helped cultivate, which climaxes yearly with it's championship competition. Obviously this tiny niche of a documentary may fall flat with people who are television junkies, anti-intellectual or the opposite of inquisitive, as the introduction into this bizarre but honorable subculture does tend to alienate with the history and preparation of these puzzles which can be all too apathetic to your average viewer. Just let the film's character's set root however, and an entirely human element comes into the staunch equation, much like the words that render themselves visible only when filling in others around it for these dictionary junkies. With the chronicling of several potential crossword champs culminating in last year's competition, Wordplay has taken something intrinsically elitist and rendered it universal with the frenzied competition leaving viewers in suspense until the final pencil is dropped, much like the recent spelling bee fad, but to me even more impressive given the insane amount of knowledge needed to seriously compete. Celebreties from all walks of life also help diversify, demystify, and clarify why this underrated tradition will continue to be the true coffee for the soul.",Plot,Others,Others
"Dubbed and low-budget, this horror movie is long, boring, and not particularly interesting except for the parapsychologist whose presence and storyline is wasted, Kevin McCarthy completed wasted, and a plot premise that held promise but wasn't fully utilized by a script that seemed to wander. Fortunately Mr. McCarthy gets to continue to perform in contemporary roles even now, particularly SLIPSTREAM (2007). Michael Moriarity is also not given sufficient opportunity to shine in this movie either. And Mr. Moriarity continues to gain better recognition since this movie.

"Robert Aldrich is one of the greatest directors of all time, of the films I've seen he produced two stone-cold all-time classics, 'Kiss Me Deadly' and 'Ulzana's Raid', one of my favourite guilty pleasures 'The Dirty Dozen', as well as highly notable cult films such as The Killing of Sister George and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, and I'm sure many others I haven't seen. He was a prolific director noted for being able to film to a high standard in different genres and styles, defying the auteur theory of current popularity. Quite how then he created such an incredibly offensive movie then is a matter to ponder over and only worth considering because of the director's fame.<br /><br />The film focuses on a group of puerile, violent, immoral patrol officers and their antics. Once a week they take over the local park for drunken hilarity, and shooting at ducks. Choir practice as they call it. It is hard to think of a more dislikeable bunch. We have uber-redneck Officer Roscoe Rules who enjoys beating up homosexuals; Officer 'Spermwhale' Whalen whose hobby is to continually question authority, undermine his department, and generally spread bad vibes; Officer 'Balls' Hadley, and his good lady, officer 'No Balls' Hadley, the continuous butt of sexual harassment and discrimination; Sergeant Scuzzi (played by Burt Young of Rocky fame) an unkempt unwashed slob from vice who everyone thinks is the precinct janitor; Officer Francis Tanaguchi, the squad's pet 'gook'. etc. These guys are more interested in playing pranks on their superiors and starting fights with 'greasers' than in protecting and serving.<br /><br />What is astonishing is that apparently the portrayal of this scurvy bunch is actually realistic of police behaviour of the time. Some people think that this redeems the movie, I would suggest however that the treatment of these officers is far too sympathetic. We are supposedly meant to rejoice at the end when all officers involved in the shooting of an innocent gay teenager receive slaps on the wrist. The treatment of homosexuals as simpering, lisping queens is incredibly offensive, particularly the gentleman in the park walking a pink poodle and savouring an encounter with 'a naked man tied to a tree'.<br /><br />Another reviewer claims that you can't expect much more off of a bunch of Vietnam vets with only high-school diplomas, my goodness have ideals sunk so low? I remember a scene in the film 'Electra Glide in Blue' when a Vietnam Vet who was a highway patrolman gave a 'perp' who was also a vet advice that he couldn't use his service record as an excuse to drop out and behave badly. There is much better moral authority from that movie. No-one needs an excuse for failure, and definitely the officers in this movie have none.<br /><br />I think the film promotes a stereotypical view of sadomasochism and vice in general, and because it is apologist and even sympathetic in it's approach to the immorality and more importantly extreme irresponsibility of the police officers, I would call it a truly Fascist movie.",Directional Techniques,Plot,Others

It's great to see Niels Olsen in this type of role, not playing his usual wacky roles but instead a romantic lead - yet another surprise.

"Not as bad as ""Carnivore"", this low budget film is still sh*t, but I have more respect for it then I have for ""The Worst Movie Ever, Carnivore"". Anyways...Two teens on their way to a backwoods party come across a beautiful young woman (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) having car trouble, so they go into the woods to find campers she said she saw, they run into Ranger Bill, and he starts telling them these campfire stories. There are 3 stories, one involves a lunatic killer, the other a haunted Indian/weed pipe and the last one is yet another killer story. Personally I liked the last story the best, but that is not saying much. I mistakenly bought Carnivore in a 5 dollar bin at Wal mart, I got this at Christmas. There was a deal if you buy one movie, you get another one, my mom picked it while she was getting the ""Awesome"" Dog Soldiers.<br /><br />The acting is mostly high school level and the music is really lame. The worst performance is ""Ranger Bill"" played by David Johansen, he really sinks this movie. I will admit, at the beginning I had hopes for it, it was going alright, then they meet up with Bill and it goes downhill from there. Now the acting is as bad as Carnivore (I'll be making lots of references to it) but it is worse than Evil Dead. So you get the idea, the best performance is from a guy who has 2 lines it, the escaped lunatic mental killer in the first story. <br /><br />The first story, about a group of jocks picking on a school handyman, doesn't fair much better in it's acting or production values. Once it gets going there is a level of creepiness to it but the whole set up before the climax is so poorly done that you find yourself caring very little about what happens.<br /><br />Aside from some poor special effects (well good in a high school class project sort of way) the second story involving three troublemakers looking to profit from the murder of a native man, fails to really grab the viewer. There isn't much wrong with the story it just doesn't do much until the twist ending. At that point everything registers and the story makes sense, unfortunately it's not much fun getting to that point.<br /><br />The final, and best, story is a nice little ""who-done-it"". While the story, of four friends getting together for a night of ""passion"" which ends in murder, doesn't really set itself up as well as it could, it does contain the most suspense of the 4 stories. This entry contains the best of everything in the movie, best story, acting and suspense. The topper is that is also contains the best ending as you continue to guess who the culprit is.<br /><br />If you are the kind of fan who likes low budget campy kind of stuff, then be my guest. If you thought carnivore was at the very least okay, then give this one a try, it has a lot of of screen gore, like chainsaw scene in Scarface. For instance, the lead jock's neck and a saw come to meet, but all you see is the blood drip onto his chest. There's no nudity, hardly any language this movie doesn't feel like a real horror movie to me, just some kind of thriller, with one or two horror elements thrown in.",Visual Effect,Performance,Directional Techniques
"I've been frequenting YouTube a lot lately in order to search for various movies I'd like to see that happen to be in the public domain (and many that aren't that haven't been taken off). Many of these movies are shown in segments that last little more than ten minutes each though there are some exceptions like this one that was shown in its one hour, seven minute entirety. It's one of the few surviving films of Theda Bara who is a pioneer as an alluring sex symbol of the movies. Here she likes to take happily married rich men and play with their emotions for the fun of it. Having said all that, while I found Ms. Bara's vamping pretty entertaining near the end, the first 30 minutes of A Fool There Was almost put me to sleep since that time mainly concerned the man she was fooling with's family. It probably didn't help that many messages that were shown on screen were mainly blurry. So for that, I'd only recommend A Fool There Was for any silent movie buff out there. P.S.

"It's very easy to criticise a film like ""for the boys"", after all it is sentimental and there is singing, a sure fire vote killer. Despite this I liked it, in fact I more than liked it. Why because it has a heart it may be sentimental sometimes but it works, the singing works, and there isn't that much of it.<br /><br />The reason this film really works is Bette Midler that age old phrase a tour de force is the only thing that you can say, the woman is fantastic. Sassy, vulnerable, moving. She brings to the part a great depth and an impressive range of emotions, most of which are underplayed, making them all the more powerful for it. Well deserving of her Oscar nomination and a little robbed not being chosen as the winner. James Cann is also very good and the production values are high well written and all in all much better than you might think.<br /><br />Yes there are some dodgy bits like the old age make up, though the makeup in the sixties was better, the ending is weak and it was a pity to go out with a whimper considering the rest of the film had such balls.

However, the pauses were too long, but Lee's mastery made it worth waiting to see his moves. The scene with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (the last recorded piece) was better in the later part of the fight and even turned convincing.<br /><br />John Little did an excellent job of directing this documentary. He allowed first hand witnesses to speak freely. It is clear from the start of the film that it was made as a reverence to Mr. Lee - a world class person and martial arts master.

"whilst as a comedy this film is very patchy and sometimes excruciatingly vulgar, what makes it watchable is the Moore/Cook relationship. Cook is by far the funnier, more dedicated and original.his quick-witted thought processes are brilliant though i did sometimes wonder if he was simply trying to be as shocking as possible simply for the sake of it. Moore often seems past caring,often simply following cook's lead but perhaps it is the strain of Cook's obvious resentment that knobbles him. certainly he seems to be struggling to keep up with Cook's genius, but then i've always felt Cook was the more talented. the material is often of a sexual nature, sometimes (mock?) misogynistic and swearing is prolific. watching this it's clear to see how comedy today is often very derivative.

This is the perfect movie for teenagers to watch for the scare factor but overall pretty bad. There was hardly any gore shown and the acting is sub par.

"Five Senses is a Canadian film noir playing at an art theater near you. Set against a gray fall Toronto background, it tells the stories of a menagerie of individuals leading frustrating, incomplete and unfulfilling existences. One of the five human senses [hearing, seeing, smelling, feeling or tasting] takes on a dominant role in the lives of several of the main characters. All the players have a relationship issue, or two, or three. The story is told around the central event of a missing person, although not all of the characters are directly involved. Five Senses is an award winning film in Canada, but to others it may be just an example of government effort to encourage creative film making [and thus indirectly censor and control content]. The story line has legs, but cannot walk. Each individual story is compelling, but few are fully developed. The `plot' is poorly structured, the main characters largely unrelated, and the message oblique. Finally, the movie has a stopping point, but not no real end.

"I got to see the widely publicized in the West movie ""Enemy at the Gates"", directed by Jean Jaques Annaud. After ""Saving Private Ryan"", which had left an overall good impression, I hoped that this Hollywood product would turn out to be on the same level. But contrary to my expectations... Well, let's start from the beginning. <br /><br />From the first moments I was struck by the rosy, well-fed faces of the Russian soldiers going to the front. Of course, I understand that life in the West is nice and sweet, but where were the makeup artists? All Soviet soldiers wore brand new greatcoats. Throughout the entire movie I only saw well-fed, not to say fat, faces, and even Danilov's three day stubble (incidentally, why does he walk around unshaven in the army?) badly masks his well-groomed face. I think the director never even considered the fact that life on the Soviet home front in 1942 wasn't sweet, McDonalds restaurants just weren't there, and sausages didn't get buttered. I was also amused about how people riding inside the freight rail cars were standing. I think the director has never even tried to imagine how it felt to ride in such a car, how it shakes you from side to side, and far from anyone would manage to stay on his feet. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the train arrives at some station, all the civilians are unloaded, soldiers are herded inside, and... some men started locking the cars! That's right! It turns out that Soviet soldiers had to be padlocked. Why? I don't know. Probably, the director believes that our grandfathers fought only from fear, that if it was up to them, they would've ran away, and nobody would've been left to fight the valiant German army. <br /><br />Meantime, the train arrives at the Stalingrad station, the padlocks are unlocked, and evil officers start dragging the soldiers out of the cars! And another political officer stands nearby (probably, the chief one, and a big boss above the other political officers), waves a red flag, and yells into a tin megaphone. I don't know how our Western comrades see this picture, but it sent me into a spasm of laughter. I haven't seen such a silly scene even in the comedy series ""Fitil'"" (Fuse). But speaking seriously, this is already an insult, and it's more serious than it could seem in the beginning. Russian soldiers are shown as dumb cattle, led by the evil devils-political officers. And incidentally, political officers were different. Sh*t can occur anywhere, not just among the political officers, that's why depicting them in such perverted manner looks extremely insulting. And that is exactly how they are depicted! I specifically made several screen shots so that you could see that people with the most disgusting faces were selected for the roles of political officers. I don't know, why Jaques Annaud feels personally slighted by the political officers, maybe they stole his money or a cow, but his bitter hatred for our grandfathers literally oozes from the screen! <br /><br />The scene where the soldiers were unloaded from the train reminded me of a mass escape from a psychiatric hospital, but not the Red Army. I don't know, perhaps the US Army troops unload in just such a manner? <br /><br />The scene of an attack. I was simply shocked by the fact that the attack began at the whistle of a mad officer! Who proposed this nonsense to the director? Or did he think really hard, and then couldn't come up with anything better? Probably it's what they call ""artistic license"". The attack itself follows the best traditions of the Western idea of how could the Russians attack. In other words - complete rubbish. Soldiers simply run as fast as they can at the machine guns, like a herd of cattle! Machine guns fire long bursts at them. This insulting stupidity, under the name of ""Human Waves"", was invented in the West during the times of the Cold War, and Jaques Annaud simply faithfully portrayed that fairy tale on the big screen.",Plot,Others,Others

In so doing, he must gain the confidence of the citizens that Reconstruction will proceed with an emphasis on the law for everyone, not for a single man or for the army that won the War.<br /><br />I found it interesting that Clay Allen (Ronald Howard) distrusted Drango because the Major was an honest man. There seems to be a corollary there that resonates with the current state of political correctness, but I digress. The ebb and flow of the story with characters slowly taking sides was my best takeaway from the film. It helped that there was a great cast of familiar character actors here from the genre, folks like Milburn Stone, Walter Sande, Parley Baer and the venerable Donald Crisp. Julie London and Joanne Dru are also effective in somewhat understated roles, even though important to the story. John Lupton probably deserved a larger presence as Drango's adjutant, but I guess that's how the saber rattles.<br /><br />Overall, an intriguing Western with an out of the ordinary theme that moves along at a nice pace. The traditional good guy ending is tested along the way by forces that pit the citizens of a small town against each other, much like the Civil War did to the country. As a microcosm of that larger conflict, ""Drango"" delivers it's message well.",Performance,Plot,Others
"""Nevermore"" is the brainchild of Thomas Zambeck, a man who has worked in various capacities for the film industry all of his adult life, including employment with the biggest distributor of films today (which shall remain nameless). This is the story of John Usher (Judd Nelson), an ex-CEO who believes his wife (Jennifer O'Dell) is trying to drive him insane. To catch her in the act, he invites an old friend to watch over the house and keep an eye on his wife. But then john begins to suspect that his friend, Devin Blayliss (Vincent Spano), cannot be trusted either.<br /><br />Zambeck has crafted his film as a combination of Edgar Allen Poe (note the use of ""Usher"" and the title) and 1940s films such as ""Gaslight"". His goal is to bring back real' suspense to the thriller, and I think we can say that he has succeeded in this respect. The plot unravels slowly -- but not too slowly -- and relies almost exclusively on dialogue to carry the film. Relying on dialogue can kill a film if you have an attention-deficit audience or poor scripting. While the former is unavoidable, the latter is not a problem here -- the dialogue is superb, through and through.<br /><br />What shines is the way the conversations not only carry the plot forward, but stories that seem to be ""subplots"" are in many ways integral. Devin's explanation that an artist must play God with his audience turns out to be crucial, and even the sheriff's unusual gerbil story has a deeper significance when one opens their mind to the possibilities. (If the sheriff has any ""stand-out"" scene, it is the gerbil scene, and is worth watching twice.) The one technical problem I ran across was poor sound quality on occasion (lack of a proper sound stage caused echoes), but there was never a moment you couldn't hear the actors, so unless you're picky, you shouldn't have a problem with this. (Keep in mind our friend Rolfe Kanefsky had ""Nightmare Man"" in theaters and distributed on DVD everywhere, and his quality isn't particularly stunning.) Regardless of sound, the video quality was great (this is no mere indie film), the directing and cinematography is skilled (not innovative, but at certainly experienced and knowledgeable), and the acting is flawless.<br /><br />And why shouldn't the acting be flawless? We're talking about Judd Nelson! ""The Breakfast Club""? Or, perhaps horror fans have see ""Cabin by the Lake"" and its abysmal sequel? Nelson is the sort of actor you want in your film -- he brings the wit, animation and charm of Charlie Sheen without the unnecessary flash. (Had Sheen been in this picture, for example, I don't know if I would have remembered the character's name, or simply have referred to him as ""Charlie Sheen"".) I don't want to see Nelson become stretched too thin, but seeing him in more horror/thriller titles wouldn't bother me in the slightest.<br /><br />At this time, ""Nevermore"" is not available to the general audience. But I want suspense fans to remember the name, because Zambeck brings classic suspense out of the attic, polishes it up, and displays it for the next generation. We've become accustomed to in your face action and excitement, but if done properly, slowing it down is a nice change of pace. And Zambeck does it properly. Keep your eyes open for ""Nevermore"".",Performance,Directional Techniques,Plot

"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn is the sequel to the ultimate experience in grueling terror. Evil Dead II is the definitive cult flick and perhaps my favorite horror film (top five at least). Bruce Campbell takes on the role of Ash once again in this hilariously horrific sequel to a legendary movie. Few sequels live up to the original and fewer still surpass it. This is one of those rare instances. This movie is out of this world. Sam Raimi is a genius with a camera and has gone on to create some damn fine films. He deserves every amount of success he has gained. The script is inventive, highly original, and funny as all hell. It's a mix of horror, laughs, and gore; or splatstick as Campbell calls it. Once again, Campbell's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission. If that doesn't get you the laughing deer head will. Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn is a true horror masterpiece. A completely original concept, some screwy camera angles, and one Bruce Campbell make for an entertaining combination.

"Mercenary for Justice starts as corrupt CIA agent John Dresham (Luke Goss) & all round bad guy Anthony Chapel (Roger Guenveur Smith) arrange the kidnapping of the French Ambassador in a remote African island using hard as nails Gulf war veteran John Seeger (co-executive producer & uncredited co-writer Steven Seagal) & some of his mates as cover, plausible deniability & all that apparently. John isn't happy when he learns the truth & is even less happy when his best mate Radio Jones (Zaa Nkweta) is killed during the fighting. Back in the US & John promises to look after Radio's widow Shondra (Faye Peters) & young son Eddie (Tumi Mogoje) but Chapel is hired by billionaire Greek Arab arms dealer Ahmet Dasan (Peter Butler) to break is son out of prison & kidnaps both Shondra & Eddie in order to force Seeger to carry out the break. Seeger isn't happy & his mood doesn't improve & sets out to gain revenge on those who double crossed him & are threatening the lives of his friends family...<br /><br />This Arubian, American & South African co-production was directed by Don E. FauntLeRoy who is also credited as cinematographer Mercenary for Justice was the second of three awful straight-to-video/DVD action flicks he made with Seagal (the other's being Today You Die (2005) & Urban Justice (2007) which are just as bad) & at this stage I seriously doubt whether Seagal will ever make a decent action film again, entertaining action fare such as Hard to Kill (1990), Marked for Death (1990), Out for Justice (1991) & the two Under Siege (1992, 1995) films seem a distant memory from a very long time ago. One of the main problems with Mercenary for Justice in my opinion is that it's insanely complicated & tries to be too clever, there are all sorts of vague double crosses & ulterior motives & supposed twists & turns that are just so contrived & convoluted that they make little sense & are so badly written & presented end up making the whole film feel like a complete unfocused mess. No-ones motives are ever fully revealed, I still don't really know what that CIA guy played by Luke Goss is all about, why were Seagal & his men fighting at the start, who was Chapel & why did he hire people he couldn't control & the whole thing is just a mess that jumps around from scene to scene trying to be clever but it's so poorly put together it's annoyingly confusing. Even though it only lasts for about an hour & a half it feels much, much longer which is never a good sign, the dialogue is terrible, the character's are not fleshed out & their motives are never made clear & there isn't even much action in it which is the final nail in it's coffin really as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />These days Seagal is fat, you can see it & he's out of shape & not that menacing & he looks sluggish, slow & unconvincing in the action scenes. There are one or two fights which are quite violent but for the most part he leaves the action to other people & is it any coincidence that one of the other main character's is fatter than he is? I am sure that guy Bulldog is there to make sure Seagal isn't the fattest person on screen during the action! During the old days Seagal's action scenes were based around brutal martial arts violence & amusing one-liners, these days he can barely walk yet alone pull those moves off. There are a few explosions, a few shoot-outs & some fights but nothing special or that memorable.<br /><br />According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $15,000,000 which I don't believe for a second, there is no way this cheap looking film cost that much. Apparently shot in Bulgaria & South Africa. The acting sucks, Seagal minus pony tail mumbles his way through the film as usual while Luke Goss has managed to put this turkey behind him having appeared in the recent Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008).<br /><br />Mercenary for Justice is another terrible low budget shot in Eastern Europe action flick with Seagal who really should either lose some weight or call it a day & realise that he can't make these action films anymore.

"Blood Shed/Crazed/slipping Into Darkness was the first movie I ever reviewed on IMDB. Initially I totally bashed the film. After A second viewing I take it back completly!!! The fact that the video art work makes it look like a violent-gore film lead to my negative review. I was expecting a gore fest and instead got a film with low body count and no gore. This film is actually very good. Their are a lot of interesting little things in this movie proving way ahead of the current events of our time. The lead character is constantly having flashbacks of his childhood. Most interesting is the priest flashbacks, the film seems to hint that he was molested by a priest especially of the quick shots of the boy on his knees possibly in a confessional booth. Ironically this issue is currently all over the news. It's almost as if the writer knew of a dirty little secret and was exposing it with this film. The character's army flashbacks are interesting too, especially since real life serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer had a bad experience in the army as well. It seems to me at second look that this film is a realistic look of how a lonley individual with serious past issues can slowly become completly insane and end up murdering people. To top it off there is some funny dialogue by the old ladies in this film to soften the serious tone. A second look at this film reveals a seriously under rated study of insanity. The original title Slipping into Darkness fits the movie better than the Blood Shed tag which will steer you the wrong way!",Plot,Others,Others
"Put together a charming story, a hilarious ""Jazz Singer"" parody as a plotline, and one of the most catchy, toe-tappin' knee-slappin' ditties ever used in an animated short, and you have ""I Love to Singa"", probably one of the ten best cartoons of all times. A proud owl concertmaster (who absolutely DETESTS jazz and will not allow it in his house!) anxiously awaits with his wife the hatching of their four eggs. The magical day comes and the owls give birth to an accomplished tenor in a little black tuxedo, a virtuosic violinist, a skillful fluitist, and...what's THIS?!?! The fourth egg cracks open, and a bawdy, free-spirited little scamp in a red cocktail lounge jacket and a blue zootsuit bowtie pops fourth, and this little guy comes out SWINGIN'! He's layin' down that big beat that all the hep-cats dig. He's croonin' a hot little number while doing a haughty Vaudeville strut! This angers his father beyond words, and the way-gone little owl is quickly thrown from his nest. Destitute and down-hearted, our ever-chipper little owl-pal (whose name happens to be Owl Jolson!) finds a radio talent search being held nearby and is overcome with joy. After several disappointing entries at the competition, Owl Jolson shows up and MAN, the kid blows everyone away! But when his folks show up, he thinks his fun is over, so he quickly tries to disguise his red-hot boogie woogie and starts singing some sappy ol' funeral parlor tune or somethin', which really doesn't jive with the deejay. It looks like his chance is lost, but all at once, his father repents of his ignorance, and states his pride in his son, telling him that it's perfectly okay for him to singa about a moona and a June-a and a springa! The kid takes up the number from there, wowing the deejay and the radio audiences, taking home first prize, sealing his bright future in jazz and claiming his place in the sun! This is a really cute little 'toon, even for a guy of my nineteen years who doesn't watch cartoons much. I always get a kick out of our owl hero going for the gusto and learning to always be true to himself. The title song WILL get stuck in your head, there's no avoiding that, but hey, it's a GREAT song to have stuck there! What a loving tribute to Al Jolson, and what a classic, unforgettable cartoon, even to this day! Grownups, do your children a big favor, make sure they see this one! The lesson is timeless, and your kids will love the music. Enjoy!!!",Plot,Music,Others
"The title of this film is extremely misleading. I figured that the documentary would cover the CIA, FBI, and federal government's investigations into John Lennon's political activities, revealing little known unclassified documents and giving us some idea as to the depth that the probe into Lennon's activities went. Instead, the movie dragged on for an hour and a half serving no other purpose other than that of a drive down memory lane for Beatles fans. All information presented in the film would have already been known by anyone who was either alive during the 60's or is functionally literate. Even the montaging is poor. The ceaseless clips of Lennon and Yoko could easily have been put together by a high school AV department. Essentially, I went into the movie expecting to learn something I didn't know, but instead came out bored stupid and amazed that even I, a child of the 80's who had no personal experience with the Lennon era, already knew everything the movie had presented, and then some.",Others,Others,Others
"Krug from LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (David A. Hess) made this slasher movie with a script from the star of THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN (Alex Rebar). The night scenes are so incompetently photographed that you can't tell what the hell is going on, which could cause some alarm if the daylight scenes were any good, but since everything is equally stupid, blame whoever, in front of or behind the camera, you want. <br /><br />Jennifer Runyon is the sweet, milk-drinking blonde virgin Nancy, who is stuck at a boarding school with her obnoxious and lascivious female friends. When their boyfriends fly in for a sex-filled Holiday weekend, a nut dressed like Santa Claus prowls around and kills most of them off. People are killed with arrow, knife, axe, rock, airplane propeller and various other sharp things, most of the women get naked and a decapitated head hangs in the shower. One girl does a cop who comes over to help them. The cop is played by Hess (who appears uncredited). This forgettable horror film wraps up with a pathetic and desperate twist ending. <br /><br />TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT is noteworthy mostly as one of at least three killer Santa Claus movies to predate SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT. The other two (which are both much better) are the Joan Collins segment in the anthology TALES FROM THE CRYPT (1971) and the wonderfully bizarre Christmas EVIL (1980).",Performance,Directional Techniques,Plot

"In her office, late at night, Mary (Corr), a psychologist, takes a voicemail from the father of a girl who has committed suicide whilst under her care, urging her that it's time to 'let go'. Having lost her position through this unfortunate event, Mary finds it very hard to do so, and scribbles down the man's number only to see it vanish beneath the remnants of a teacup, upended by her friendly cat. An attempt at remembering the number leads to a call to an elderly man, Simon (Fenton), who only moments before was poised, barefoot on a snowy ledge, about to leap to his death into the dark waters below Against the shadowy silhouette of the bridge, blue-tinged and feathered with falling snow, director Richard Raymond elicits a most magical and haunting sense of other-worldliness, the stylised heightened reality an escapee of a Tim Burton landscape, demonstrating all of Burton's delicious dark melancholy but devoid of his black humour. However, this is no triumph of style over substance: Raymond gently unfurls his tale, Mary at first still as she receives the message, her agitation growing as she takes the call from Simon and realises he is on the brink of killing himself, and then her flight into the night as she attempts to lay her own ghosts to rest by saving another, all leading to a taught and chilling climax.<br /><br />Whilst an interesting combination, there may not be the highest of expectations for the pairing of the lead singer of a pop group with Doctor Legge from Eastenders. In that case, be prepared for a most pleasing surprise. The pacing of the film is dependent on the camera exploring the performers' actions and gestures and, within their dialogue, to linger on their expressions. As such, any mis-timing or errors would be magnified to the audience. That they both deliver convincing, gripping and moving performances is a credit to both actors and Raymond as director. Corr, previously seen in The Commitments and Evita, the Madonna vehicle in which she was criminally allowed only one line of what should have been her character's own song, has her sights set on an acting career and the evidence on display here leads one to suspect she'll be most successful. Underplaying rather than overplaying is a most subtle skill and Corr demonstrates this with aplomb. Fenton, meanwhile, ranges from pathos to simmering rage, as his anger at his life erupts and, his face a close-up of crevice shadowed contortion, bores into the viewer. The interplay between seasoned thespian and fresh-faced newcomer is nicely balanced, and the unlikely two-hander deftly explores a range of human emotions. As the falling snow is by turn luminescent white in the lamplight, or midnight blue against the darkened night, it reflects how the film's themes of regret, guilt, blame, loyalty and redemption are rarely black or white but instead change, Monet-esquire, dependent on the light in which they're seen.<br /><br />Are there flaws? One or two, but even these are debatable. The plot is stretched slightly and could be shorter, but to lose the slow-burning build would almost certainly detract from the atmospherics of the film. The ending, too, is not as dramatically climatic as one has been lead to suspect, but it is satisfying and quite haunting, resolving itself and yet is ambiguous enough to leave the viewer revisiting the tale in the mind's eye.<br /><br />The Bridge has already attracted a considerable fanbase and plaudits from home and abroad. It's legacy will be as a beautiful, melancholy calling card that heralded the beginning of a most promising career for both its director and its leading lady, but one which will remain a favourite in it's own right in any viewer's personal film collection.",Music,Directional Techniques,Performance

It does not give meaning, why the blonde woman kills her lover just to find another woman, who will make her laundry. When she is killing her girlfriend, you get the impression, that she is heterosexual, but she has to be a lesbian at the end - because the film wants to tell you, that lesbians are mean, stupid and, in a way, helpless.

"...and so is ""Luv"". What might've been a mod, madcap romantic comedy is just an exercise in shouting (you'll never forget that Jack Lemmon plays ""Harry""--it's all you hear from the other performers). A suicidal man is brought down from a bridge-railing by an old school friend who has other plans for the guy: fix him up with his unhappy wife so he can marry a fitness enthusiast. Had possibilities, few of which are realized. One is tempted to put some of the blame for this mess on Lemmon (who does some uncharacteristically sloppy slapstick here), but Clive Donner's direction should bear the brunt of it--he has no clue how to present this story. Based on the play, ""Luv"" has bright opening moments but soon sinks into theatrical clichés, the kind that creak and wheeze with age. Worse, it's a visual insult, with tatty color photography that only serves to expose the cheap production. What a shame!

"What is amazing with Miike Takashi's cinema is its ability to surprise you. This film is no exception.<br /><br />Wery aware of its medium (a DV camera) Miike uses this cheap look to touch the viewer more deeply. The credibility comes from this disturbing proximity of the image (It looks like your holiday film). Recurrent use of subjective perspective, emphasis this. But, instead of falling into a dogma-like movie, Miike pushes the plot to its most unacceptable extremities, sometimes flirting with the fantastic genre.<br /><br />Miike plays with multi point of views, particularly during the opening scene, in which the girl takes photographs of her father before they sleep together. Desorienting the spectator.<br /><br />What astonished me when I saw that movie, is the amount of humor (noir)that grows up during the film. Here, shocking situations (necrophilia, humiliations...) become really funny. And from an awful family relationship, the plot evolves to an objectively even worst situation, but subjectively a much better situation for the characters.<br /><br />Miike plays here with conventional Hollywood vision about family and gives a much cynical and humorist meaning to unity!

More likely its a rip off of Fatal Attraction.

This is when you think it can't have been a True Story because it starts to get into the realms of fiction with plots and subplots based on the storyline of a woman lusting after her lawyer who tells her he's happily married.We find out later he DID once have an affair which nearly destroyed him.

Newman, giving the film noir detective's narration in perfect form, sets the stage well and gets us quite interested in his life and perspective. Hackman, Sarandon, Reese Witherspoon, and Schriver chime in with very interesting characters. We appear to be in for a treat.<br /><br />But, then it goes nowhere, except cliche-land. The result is dreary and listless as unmotivated characters go through the motion. The ending turns the interest level back up somewhat, but not enough to salvage the overall experience.

"STB is an Italian movie through and through - the only atypical quality being that it doesn't stink. (And that there isn't the usual amount of shouting.) This is a sort of sentimental road movie/comedy with the obligatory festival-crowd-pleasing surreal scenes, such as people freezing up at stations or a huge balloon/jelly-fish/whatever lifting up all of Mastroianni's kids up into the air. That's the sort of Felini-like stuff which IQ-starved film students go absolutely ga-ga over, regardless of whether it relates to the rest of the movie or not. ""Weird stuff! Yeaaah!""<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, STB isn't dull and that's all that matters. Besides, its experimental approach (if one can call it that) never has an air of pretentious baloney about it. Perhaps we have Mastroianni to thank for that, who plays it very down-to-Earth. Even when he spits out wise words of advice to his offspring there isn't that unrealistic expectation from the viewer to gasp with shock, bewilderment and awe, something very common in so many other European movies, especially from the 60s and 70s. Too many directors think they reveal the secrets of the universe in their modest little underachieving flicks. Not the case here; at least not in annoying amounts. STB is likable and even amusing at times.<br /><br />As for the ""experimental approach"", if every other movie that Italians (and other Continentals) release has the same type of surreal silliness going on, then it isn't really experimental anymore, is it? It becomes normal, unsurprising, stale even.<br /><br />It's far easier to cobble up a script chock-full of ""metaphoric"" nonsense than to actually sit down and write a compact, stirring script with a beginning, middle, and end. STB leans far more heavily toward the latter.",Plot,,
"Suburban Commando is a very good film and its one of Hulk Hogan`s best films.It is one of My favorite films.I was thrilled when it came out because back when wrestling was wrestling it was so fun watching the then WWF Prime Time Wrestling show and seeing the promotions on it while watching some of the best wrestling ever seen back in 1991.Anyway the film is action packed and has many,many funny moments.One of My favorite actors Christopher Lloyd stars along with the Hulkster and he is very good in it.Christopher Neame had a very short part and I think he should have had a much larger role in the film.William Ball,Shelley Duvall,Roy Dotrice,and Larry Miller all put on good performances.I was amazed to see Mark Callaway (The Undertaker) in the film.

"Ok. This movie is so bad, that much is obvious. But what struck me most about it is that it has to be the worst script ever written. Every other line is hilariously cringe-worthy. Just Rose McGowan by herself probably says about the hundred worst lines ever said in the history of cinema. This movie is so bad that it is funny at times, but on the other hand, its really just painfully AWFUL and utterly sad.<br /><br />A 1/10.",Plot,,
"This is one of the better structured movies ever put to screen. It's as complex as Lynch's Lost Highway, but that only adds to the experience. A non-linear structure (in time and space) is applied and Lucia y el Sexo blurs the line between reality and imagination.<br /><br />Basically, it's like Mulholland Drive: Most of what we see is a dream, imagination. Only a relatively small part did really happen. But this goes one step further: What part is in the eye of the beholder here, because little clues are given so the mystery format is only used to keep us entertained at a basic level.<br /><br />A writer is the center here. Some parts of his life are probably true (trouble at home, sickness), others are ambiguous, others are certainly imagined. He is in the meta-story, but also places himself in threads in the other stories that come from his imagination. His imagination is formed by applying smaller and larger events (meeting a person at a party, seeing someone in front of the house) in his personal life to his fantasies. His erotic fantasies explain the title, as sex is one of the characters of the story. One of the story lines is again about his script read on the island by one of his imagined characters. Writing the story and telling the story is done simultaneously. As he becomes sick, the characters become helpless in the story. Overall it helps a lot if you keep imagining that you're watching imagined characters being manipulated by the writer. This combines meta-story and story, real with imagination, weaving several threads in a complicated web of story lines. In the end, it is made clear that the story doesn't end but starts again halfway, giving further evidence that viewers can use their imagination at random on this and create their own story out of it.<br /><br />The meta-story is interesting, but by mixing it with the story itself we see the real story as what it is, a writing trick with imagined characters. That unfortunately diminishes the emotions a movie tries to convey. We're merely watching how a movie is structured, with the imagined story not having the usual dramatic impact.<br /><br />It's remarkable that so many people are offended about the sex scenes, as it's already in the title. Do they also complain about the presence of aliens in Alien? I found the sex scenes to be made with some honesty; and at least they didn't even shy away of male nudity.",Plot,,
"This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Literally. It was a romantic comedy, but unlike most, had no twist. Sort of like 'When Harry met Sally', which I thought was overrated, but at least had charismatic stars. I think the fact that I saw this movie when I was about fourteen, at the height of my FPJ crush and still didn't like it, really says something. I can't imagine what I would think if I saw it now. The acting wasn't stellar, since the material sucked so much. Even Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan couldn't save it, although JB was funny. Claire Forlani was okay, but forgettable, and Freddie, well, he was his usual self. Apparently the guy can act when given good material (He was in Kenneth Lonergan's 'This is our Youth' in the West End), but unfortunately none of his movies so far have been able to evidence that. The guy seems to have about four expressions: bewildered, dumfounded, just plain dumb, and something resembling constipation. At least he's pretty though, right?",Performance,,
"The story of 4 Uni students spending a few days in a World War II Bunker. It could've been soo much more. A hugely promising start, with the characters given emotional depth in the early scenes and the key relationships clearly defined. In particular, Martin Taylor (Daniel Brocklebank) is a fantastic character..it's a shame he wasn't in the hole as well, it would've been more interesting. <br /><br />The main crux of the film revolves around Liz (Thora Birch) and her youthful desire for son-of-a-rockstar Mike Steel (Desmond Harrington). However, a false start recollection and the way the film is conducted by flashbacks under psychoanalysis is not overly effective, slowing the pace down quite a lot. The claustrophobia of being trapped in an underground bunker rarely comes across and the impression I got from the trailer turned out to be false.<br /><br />I didn't expect a huge amount from this movie..It was one of those, much like ""The Gift"", where I thought it might be good and it might be bad, hopefully interesting.. The only solace I could find in this really was the intensity that was built up at various points. In flashes some of the cast are excellent, particularly in portraying the interrelations of the group members, but only in flashes. A lot of things are left unexplained. There is a death where the body is strangely scarred, and the reason for this is unexplained; the autopsy would not appear to have required such a scar to be caused, so why?<br /><br />Overall, disappointing 4/10.",Performance,Plot,
"I have no need to summarize this movie seeing as how most people tend to do that anyway so, therefore, any addition of such would simply be frivilous. However, I am somewhat disappointed to see how people tend to misinterprate this film by proclaiming that the movie's message of carpe deium is derailed by the fact that those who apply it end up losing. This could not be further from the truth. In the beginning, when the young men are first introduced to this idea of sucking the marrow out of life it is applied by the students when its results prove to be fun and joyous. The point really driven home by the movie though is to stand up for one's beliefs throughout all of life no matter how hard it may prove. Now, while the character of Neil, does try to do what he feels he must without regard to his father, in the end, he doesn't stand up at all, but simply accepts his father's authority. Some may not like it but his story serves to prove just how important it is to stand one's ground no matter how hard it may be. It's not only his character, but in fact every character in the film that does not fully understand Mr. Keating's message until the very end by finally doing what they feel is right now matter how much the opposing forces deny this basic truth. <br /><br />I urge everyone to give this movie a chance and to see it for what it really is. It may just change your life.",Performance,,
"I occasionally get sick of romantic comedies, but the other kind of chick flick--namely, the kind having to do with that pure, gushy family love--I just can't get enough of. Plus, they managed to weave this one into a suspense/thriller, and threw in another one of my favorite fictional concepts for good measure: time travel, in this film represented by the parallel dimension through which a son speaks to his father before his death 30 years ago.<br /><br />In fact, anyone who loves ""Back to the Future"" for the same reasons I do will gobble up the brain candy in ""Frequency."" The ways in which the film deals with the thought-provoking concept of changing the past, while certainly blasphemous to the field of physics, sparks some interesting conversation after the credits. <br /><br />The eerie curlicues of smoky clouds shown in the sky at various intervals attest to the fact that the makers of ""Frequency"" do not pretend to have a logical explanation for how two men can be using the same radio at the same desk in the same house to be speaking to each other over a distance of 30 years. <br /><br />I was so captivated by the secondary plot, an old unsolved murder case that quickly becomes personal when father and son play G-d, that I didn't have a chance to care about the unidimensionality of most of the characters, the flavorless dialogue or the predictability of the action. My jetlagged eyes were glued to the poor reception I have for a screen for the duration of the film. <br /><br />Retrospectively, it was no piece of art!

Rent this, if you are looking for an old-fashioned horror show, with a wildly modern twist, look no further.

"This film was made by the crown prince of gore and schlock, Hershell Gordon Lewis. It begins with some young people at a party. All of the sudden, one of the 'untamed youth' begins smashing things--at which point they all join in with the fun. What makes it rather strange is that some of them have knives and even hatchets!! Where did they hide them and what sort of folks bring hatchets?! This opening scene lasts about three times longer than it should and could have used a strong editing. Then, the credits roll along with some of the most nasal and annoying music I've heard in years. Tary Rebanar's voice is high-pitched and annoying enough to raise the dead!! Sadly, strains from his god-awful warbling came and went throughout the film.<br /><br />Once the movie begins, you'll most likely notice how bad the sound is--like it's being filmed with a super 8mm movie camera. As for the acting, everyone seems to over-emote--even the band, whose guitarist and bass player appear to be having grand mal seizures. Really...you need to see them bouncing about to believe it. I am sure the king of subtle, Lewis, instructed them on the finer points of acting and style.<br /><br />What follows are some poorly choreographed fights (I truly think Lewis just yelled out ""okay, start breaking things"" and let them wing it) and MORE destruction of rooms full of cheap furniture. And, like the first time, it seems to go on forever. You'd think these 'youth gone wild' would have gotten bored with this after a while, and so they do. For kicks, then, they fry a guy's hand on the stove, burn newspapers that sit right in front of the camera and smash apart a baby carriage. I especially loved the shot of the baby sitting in a trashcan--just looking at the punks as they did their thing. It was dumb but also kind of funny. Sadly, however, the film didn't stop there. It kept showing more and more and more of the same sort of thing--these kids beating up and humiliating adults time and time again. It really got old very quickly and just looked like padding and made up the bulk of the film. Acting and plot just didn't seem that important. Yet I was also left to wonder how they could do this so many times in broad daylight and yet the cops STILL couldn't figure out who these young whippersnappers were!!! And, considering how loud and obnoxious and noticeable the crazed kids were, you almost thought the cops in the film should have been played by Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder.<br /><br />Finally, to break the monotony of the same old attacks again and again, a group of four nice girls are invited to one of the gang's parties and are drugged and raped. But, instead of this signaling a move to more serious crimes, in the next scene the gang literally goes out and beats up little children playing baseball. I know it was supposed to be shocking but I just thought the whole thing was incredibly silly. And, once again, the scene seemed to go on way too long. However, even though it's a horrible scene, just get a load of that old lady as she watches the attack! I loved her expressions--the type that make Edith Massey seem like a brilliant thespian.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in addition to the old lady being a horrible actress, she also misidentifies who caused the problems--saying that an innocent kid was at fault for attacking an entire gang. And, the brain-addled police seem to think this is reasonable and arrest the boy. They ignore another more credible witness and don't even bother talking to the little kids! Hmm...it seems the police aren't really blind--just really, really stupid! In the following scene, by the way, you learn what else the vicious gang likes to do for fun. They play bumper pool!!! So, as the gang play, the innocent guy who was just arrested comes into the room full of these clean-cut looking thugs and threatens them!!! What part of stupid didn't this guy understand?! He has just shown that he's dumb enough to join this town's police force. Yet, oddly, we see no beat-down--just the gang enjoying six packs of everyone's favorite beverage, Carling Black Label (could they have perhaps been a sponsor!?). What happened to the dumb guy who just threatened to kill them (and without a gun or tank or even backup to help)?! What follows instead is a rape scene that showed a lot more than I'd assumed they could get away with back in 1968.<br /><br />However, apparently the gang didn't forget about the dumb guy and you see them about to exact their revenge. In the very next scene, his girlfriend calls the cops to report the threatening phone calls she got and they respond that there's nothing they can do(?). I think the Keystone Kops would have been an improvement over the police in this goofy town. What follows are more sexual assaults and mayhem until finally, finally the gang is finally stopped in a weird scene where a bike just explodes for no reason. <br /><br />This film, with a few exceptions here and there, managed to make gang violence rather boring. Too many scenes should have been shortened, there were too many attacks and not enough story. All in all, the violence just got old and dull very quickly and the story never made sense as people cannot be THAT dumb! While this is a terrible film in almost every way, for Hershell Gordon Lewis this is NOT among his worst films. No, for that you might want to try MONSTER A GO-GO and THIS STUFF'LL KILL YA. Believe it or not, however, Lewis did make one low-budget films that didn't completely suck--the surprisingly good TWO THOUSAND MANIACS. This proves that if you try hard enough, you're bound to get lucky once.",Performance,Plot,
"This sepia-sunbleached feature derives from, and features the same main characters as, the eponymous 2002-2005 Brazilian TV series about (mostly) boys in the ""favela"" hill ghettos above Rio for which Morelli did some of the writing and directing. The series, starring Darlan Cunha as Laranjinha (Wallace) and Douglas Silva as Acerola (Ace) --growing up from year to year and episode to episode--sort of grew out of the Fernando Meirelles/Kátia Lund film, 'City of God,' which in turn was based on Paulo Lins' tumultuous and partly autobiographical novel about three decades in the slums and the involvement of youth as dealers, assassins, and victims. Actually the Ace/Wallace characters as young teenagers, always played by Silva and Cunha, predate 'City of God' by two years; they appeared in a short film called 'Palace II' in 2000. The history of these films and stories is as intricate as the world they depict. Douglas Silva was the prepubescent tough in 'City of God' known by he moniker Dadinho--Lil' Dice.<br /><br />'City of Men' is warmer and more intimate than the original film. 'City of God' has been both admired for its virtuosity--it's full of tours de force of visual violence and equally brilliant feats of rapid storytelling--and condemned as reveling too much in blood and gore, making teenage killers who terrorize neighborhoods into little glamor boys. That's quite true. It's unfortunately also true that in the ghettos of Rio as of other places such as the USA, young gun-toting drug dealers are the sexy local pop stars. Maybe the earlier film fails to take a sufficiently clear moral stand, or too much reflects the viewpoints of the young favela males it depicts. Nonetheless it's exhilarating film-making. Paradoxically, it also has a more positive arc than 'City of Men,' because its hero works his way out of the slums and into mainstream Rio de Janeiro to become a photojournalist. In 'City of Men,' nothing like that happens. Instead, there is a difficult reconciliation between the two boys, on the brink of eighteen, despite a stunning revelation about their lost fathers, and one of the fathers comes back into the picture and, reluctantly at first, chooses to be a warm presence in the life of his son. Both of the boys endure moments of terrible loneliness and isolation, which reveal how isolating the world of shifting and dangerous loyalties and hills fought for and lost is for a boy who in the first place lacks parents. But the focus is on the reconciliations.<br /><br />In the TV series, the boys are in school. They face difficulties even showing up, and only one of them, Ace (Silva) really hits the books (he's also fascinated by guns of all kinds). Laranjinha is closer to turning into a young hood.<br /><br />Thugh the new movie 'City of Men' is less specific than the TV series (judging by the DVD collections of episodes that I've seen) and suffers a bit by comparison with either it or 'City of God,' the vibrancy of the life on offer in all these films is still unmistakable, as well as the attractiveness of the young actors, the warmth of the world evoked--and vernacular swiftness that of the filming and editing, which somehow is both relaxing and unnerving.<br /><br />Wallace/Laranjinha is trying to find out who his real father is; he doesn't want ""unknown"" to be on the place for ""father"" on his papers. Acerola knows his father is dead, and he wants to know what happened. He's faced with the local problem from the other side. His wife Cris (Camila Monteiro) keeps leaving their toddler son Clayton (Vinicius Oliveira) with him to take care of. He doesn't want to accept the responsibility. But if he reneges on it, he'll leave Clayton in the same place he and Wallace are in. Ace abandons Clayton on the beach early on when Madrugadão (Midnight, Jonathan Haagensen), the gang leader of the hill where they live, risks assassination to descend on a super-hot day for a swim in the ocean. He also turns some flashy cartwheels and shows off his spectacular pecs. Madrugadão, like Wallace (i.e. Darlan Cunha), is handsome and charismatic. Ace is so childish he forgets his own son; but he rushes back and finds him. And when Cris gets a job in the wealthier city of São Paulo, Ace, with great difficulty, forces himself to take on the responsibility of raising Clayton.<br /><br />Wallace (perhaps a bit too easily) finds his father, a bearded man named Heraldo (Rodrigo dos Santos), who has just gotten out of prison after serving fifteen years of a twenty-year sentence--for murder. Heraldo's beard cannot conceal the fact that he is not very mature. He hasn't shouldered the responsibilities of being a man. But he also carries the weight of suffering and gratitude.<br /><br />When rival gang leader Fasto (Eduardo ""BR"" Piranha) takes over Midnight's territory on Dead End Hill, a new gang war breaks out right in the middle of Ace and Wallace's journey of self-discovery.<br /><br />'City of Men' is a more tender, individual and grownup story than 'City of God'; from what I've seen of the TV series it grows out of, it's less specific and less witty. It works as a kind of antidote to the amorality one feels in 'City of God,' and its warmth is touching. Nor is it visually ineffective, or its sense of the milieu less rich--except. Except that it quite lacks the momentum and adrenaline-rush brilliance of 'City of God's' virtuoso film-making and editing, or the rich range of minor characters the latter has. It is a little bit meandering, and its fast jump-cut slides from scene to scene sometimes seem out of place. As the AV Club reviewer says, much has been gained in this new film, but much has been lost as well. Still 'City of Men' is well worth watching.",Plot,,

Sheridan and Benny are husband and wife Bill and Connie Fuller, about to be evicted from their apartment because of their dog shredding the hall rug. Wanting to plant roots, Connie has fallen in love with an old house and purchased it, possibly without thinking it through. There's no water, the roof leaks, and Bill falls through the floor and continually falls down the stairs.

"D.W. Griffith's first film, 'Those Awful Hats (1909),' was designed as a comical public service announcement of sorts. A few years later, the director continued to perform public services, but the complexity of his work had evolved exponentially. Much like 'A Corner in Wheat (1909),' he is here using cinema to make a profound social statement, this particular issue highlighted in the film's title: 'What Shall We Do With Our Old? (1911).' After an aging carpenter (W. Chrystie Miller) is fired from his job to make room for young workers, he is unable to find another job, leaving him, penniless, to care for his ailing wife (Claire McDowell). In order to survive, the carpenter reluctantly turns to crime, but is arrested and brought before a kindly, sympathetic judge (George Nichols). Despite the judge's understanding, it is too late for this elderly couple to be rescued from abject poverty: the wife succumbs to her illness, and the carpenter is left grieve his losses and ponder his lonely predicament.<br /><br />'A Corner in Wheat' ends with an image of hope. 'What Shall We Do With Our Old?' concludes with an image of despair, a pertinent social problem without any known solution. Griffith doesn't even attempt to propose any sort of resolution, which does admittedly come off as rather hypocritical  it is, after all, one thing to merely acknowledge a problem, and another to try and fix it. But the film is given emotional depth through an opening title that informs us that the story was ""founded upon an actual occurrence in New York City,"" assuring Griffith's undeniable social relevance. Miller is very good in the main role, showing strong emotions in response to his character's hardship. Nichols, as the judge, also does well, playing the sort of sympathetic authority-figure role that Frank Capra might later have set aside for Harry Carey or Harry Davenport. McDowell, as the carpenter's sick wife, is adequate, but quite obviously far younger  34 years old  than she was supposed to appear.",Performance,Plot,
"Following hot on the tails of the monumental success of the first TV film, Highschool Musical 2 manages to out do itself in the newest sequel of the soon to be long franchise of films to come. Part two finds the entire cast of Part one ready to celebrate the summer, when (with the help and dastardly doings of evil sharpay) the entire school manages to end up working at a posh resort. The formula is still the same: simple plot, swooning girls, and boys with squeaky clean images. This time though the quality of the music has been stepped up a notch, with a more conscious effort to write more theatrical music (with the exception of a few silly fillers). The cast is still strong with Efron and Hudgens leading the pack. Corbin Bleu is a standout actor and gets to show off his potential, and Ashley Tisdale commands the screen with her quirky off beat character. Of course there are the lines that are so cheesy that you laugh out loud, and of course the awkward moments (Efron's ""angry"" dance number comes to mind) but it's still entertaining. The real star though is Kenny Ortega who helms the project and brings some exceptional choreography and ideas to the small screen. Bravo!",Performance,Plot,Music
"First things first. This movie is clearly done in a style in which bad acting and a bad script are over dramatized to create a potential cult classic. The problem is it's just too annoying to enjoy. The acting comes across as something from an elementary school production, and the script seems like it was written by several people who didn't collaborate. Granted, the movie was made over four years, and its easy to lose track of what you are doing. The budget of $20,000 wouldn't do anyone justice, and that $20,000 didn't even come all at once, so I understand the problems. Not a great movie, but a lot of great directors had some rather questionable material come out of their first hours behind a camera.<br /><br />That said, Rusty Nails is a great guy.

I don't wish anyone the experience we had with a play he co-wrote with a brother and that was seen at the Mineta Lane Theater in New York about three years ago, in which the audience kept leaving the performance because it was insufferable. This same quality can be said about this adaptation of yet another one of his works for the theater.<br /><br />Directed by Tom Cairns, who also translated the material for the screen, shows us a couple of misfits that have been together far too long and would have been better off dissolving their marriage some time ago. The main attraction for watching the picture was Julianne Moore and Matthew Broderick, both great actors that put in a brave appearance to be in front of the camera playing these people. One wonders why hasn't Marie left Bruce a long time before? It's easier to see why Bruce has stuck to the situation because he doesn't have much to offer anyone else in her right mind.<br /><br />The film can infuriate would be viewers who would not have enough patience to sit right through it.",Others,,
"What gives with the talented Parker Posey? She can make great films with incredible comic timing (example: her great work in Christopher Guest's films) and then barely make a dent with crappy roles in crappy films like ""The Oh in Ohio"". This movie, which is about a young woman's quest for the elusive orgasm, is pretty much the same territory explored in ""ShortBus"" this year, right down to the same joke involving accidental triggering of a vibrator. I bought this film used, and should have suspected that it was a turkey if it was being sold at rental stores a mere four weeks after its DVD release. Indeed it is a turkey. Whyt Liza Minnelli, Paul Rudd, and Heather Graham would even want to be part of this escapes me. Parker? Get a better agent...fast!",Plot,,
"Jules Verne wrote about 80 novels as well as plays and short stories in his career. He began writing in 1854 with a short story called ""Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul"". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.<br /><br />Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE ""JONATHAN"", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.<br /><br />Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. <br /><br />Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.<br /><br />Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of ""Jonathan"" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.",Plot,,
"Based on a myriad of very positive comments here, as well as my experience watching the director's previous film _The Ugly_ and enjoying it, I rented _Heaven_. What an awful film! Don't believe the hype. There's a very good reason this bypassed theaters and went straight to video. It's an ugly, mean-spirited, depressing film, with characters that it is hard to understand and like. The acting is good--it's amazing to see Richard Schiff, so likeable on _The West Wing_, playing such a sleaze. Martin Donovan is good, as are Joanna Going and Patrick Malahide. Too bad the story doesn't have more going for it. And what's with the son of Donovan/Going's characters? Both of them have obvious American accents, but the kid talks like he just got off the plane from Australia or New Zealand (the latter, I guess). Other than chopping things up and presenting them out of order, so that what we think is going to happen isn't necessarily what does happen, this film really has very little going for it. _Memento_ it is NOT! Here's hoping that Scott Reynold's next film, _When Strangers Appear_ is an improvement.",Performance,Plot,
"I didn't know this film actually was a re-cut of the original when I begun watching it (remind me to check this site ALWAYS before renting a film!) so my first thought was: shenanigans! The entire first half of this ""sequel"" contains sequences  not even essentials ones  of the 1984 shocker, talked together as some sort of wraparound story by Ricky Caldwell whose brother was responsible for the infamous Christmas killing spree. The film then all of a sudden turns into a real sequel, with a summary of Ricky's repertoire as a demented killer and finally results in a grotesque 80's cheesefest where he chases a nun in a wheelchair. I don't really know how to judge the wholesome but it sure is fun. The acting skills of Eric Freeman (who plays Ricky) are bad beyond comparison and there's absolutely no depth or tension to detect in the screenplay. But on the other hand, I can't be too harsh because the murder sequences are great! Someone gets stabbed to death with an umbrella and Ricky even makes the eyes of his girlfriend's previous lover blow (by the way, why are all the jocks in 80's horror movies called Chip???). Silent Night, Deadly Night is a very stupid film.half déjà vu and half ludicrous. But you might as well describe it as a truly sweet horror treat for 80's fanatics. The sequences where nutball Ricky wanders through the streets killing people randomly and laughing ridiculously simply have to be seen to be believed. Enjoy!",Performance,Plot,

"This is one fine made movie. It has a greatly written script and a top-notch cast.<br /><br />It sounds like a cliché of course but it's a real shame that movies like these aren't being made and written anymore. At least not on such a commercially large scale and with such fine big name actors in it. Movies like this aren't made anymore simply because movies like this don't really sell, unless they are being made exceptionally good.<br /><br />It's not really a film-noir, although the movie certainly shows similarities to the atmosphere and the story also shows noir tendencies. The movie in the end is perhaps a bit too 'light' to consider it a real film-noir, also because it features quite an amount of subtle black comedy.<br /><br />The story is solidly constructed and focuses on three different characters and plot-lines that of course are all still connected to each other. The fine script was written by Hollywood legend John Huston. It features lots of deeper themes such as greed and jealousy. You really start to care about the characters and their problems. Something that isn't too common for a '40's genre movie. It's not always an easy movie to watch and follow so make sure you watch this movie with a clear head. The dialog might be a bit overlong by todays standards but its so fine written and delivered by the actors that you tend to look past this.<br /><br />The movie gets really carried by the three main characters, that equally share the screen time. I was especially impressed by Sydney Greenstreet, which also might due to the fact that he had the best- or at least most credible plot line. Peter Lorre also played a great role and gave a fine performance. Geraldine Fitzgerald was definitely the least of the three actors and she tended to overact a bit in some of the dramatic sequences. But overall her role was also really a solid one and it says something about the quality of the acting from Lorre and Greenstreet to say that Fitzgerald gave the lesser performance of the movie. Alan Napier also plays a small role. Oh man, it really seems to be that this guy is in about every 'old' movie that I watch lately. Napier received his most fame for playing the butler Alfred in the Adam West ""Batman"" series from the '60's. <br /><br />The editing of the movie was also surprisingly good and fast. Instead of long single camera sequences, the movie cuts back and forth between different camera positions in the same sequence rapidly. It gives the story speed and helps to keep you interest even during the more slow and dull moments of the movie. The fine little musical score was from acclaimed composer Adolph Deutsch, whose music suited this movie and its atmosphere really well.<br /><br />It's a fine good old fashioned quality movie, made with limited resources but with fine experts involved.<br /><br />8/10",Performance,Directional Techniques,Music
"It sure took a long time for this film to debut here, and if memory serves me right, it took almost a year, and the DVD has already been released. If not for a press screening already held, I would have thought that the film would be one of those that are difficult to pass by the censors and required some lengthy debate as to the merits for its theatrical release. That's because it deals with the current topic of terrorism in an unflinching manner, with the hijacking of religion to further the terrorists' extremist and violent ends being told in a style yet unseen from films such as The Kingdom, Syriana, The Siege and Body of Lies, to name but a few films dealing with the topic.<br /><br />I am a keen admirer of Don Cheadle's film performance, especially in dramatic roles, and here he plays Samir Horn, a devout Muslim and US citizen caught up in a web of intrigue and international terrorism acts. We see how he employs his skills of bomb-making, honed from his US Special Operations days as an officer, and seemingly looks like a rogue, US domestic terrorist aiding foreign groups in their operations to harm the world. But there's more than meets the eye to Samir, and here's where Cheadle excels in putting that level of ambiguity into a role that raises moral questions about doing something for the ""greater good"", no matter the costs.<br /><br />Chasing him around the world are FBI counter-terrorism agents Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Max Archer (Neal McDonough), who are clearly like fish out of water when operating outside their legal jurisdictions. Unfortunately for the two actors, their roles here as the downright good guys are always a step or two behind the terrorist cells, which in some ways mirror that in real life. Without good intelligence, you're always reactive, and it takes a lot to be on top of the game, especially when tactics employed are normally innovately discharged. We get to see a number of ""no-brainer"" tactics that the cells employ which are effective if you think about it, which makes it all the more dangerous should they be used because they actually can be.<br /><br />But the most dangerous game to be playing from the side of the good guys, is the refusal to share intelligence or to combine resource, drawing lines in the sand and setting up turfs. The bickering between agencies all point to missing out on the bigger picture on one hand, while on the other the need for confidentiality also brings up operational sensitivity in order not to jeopardize any current missions, and this need to know service also stems from being overly cautious of any internal moles that would betray efforts in progress. In some ways, this is like Infernal Affairs being played all over again.<br /><br />I suppose that without the balanced view and very verbatim statements made toward the end renouncing violence and misguided teachings, this film would probably not be given the green light. But it did, and presented a very though provoking thinking man's action thriller set in this age of cloak and dagger terrorism. Sure it has some loopholes and the unnecessary (and unavoidable) collateral damage, but watch this for the performance all round and an engaging storyline that might not keep you guessing all the way once the cat is out of the bag, but does enough.",Plot,,
"I have seen ""The Age of Innocence"" about 15 times since 1994, and find the argument as to whether it is boring or not to be fascinating. Period films are not for everyone, and if you lack an appreciation for subtlety then maybe something like ""Joe Dirt"" may be better suited for you. But what lies beneath this wonderful movie is a priceless ode to individuality.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer plays Ellen Olenska, a proto-feminist who flees from her failing European marriage to the home of her blood relatives in 1870's New York Society. She's been away for most of her life and the States are foreign to her, but she quickly realizes that she is viewed as threat, a black sheep ---and Society reacts to her as it would to a dirty black spot on a carpet or on one of their tuxedo shirts. ""Harmony could be shattered by a whisper"", as well narrated by Joanne Woodward.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis plays Newland Archer, an up-and-rising patriarch who sees something in her that no one else in his rich circle could offer him: an independent viewpoint to life. As a lawyer and a powerful member of his family, he bravely tries to protect Ellen from basically everyone, esp. members of their own family. Despite all of her difficulties, Countess Olenska refuses to part from her individuality: she smokes in front of Newland, does not hide from men in social situations, and criticizes her surroundings. Archer doesn't necessarily fall in love with her as a person but with what she represents: Romanticism and escape.<br /><br />There is a lot to love about this film, which is more like a piece of art than a movie. Every scene and every bit of dialogue denotes elegance and brutality simultaneously. All of the leading and supporting characters are so believable and well formed that they trump anything Hollywood has been throwing at us in recent months. And the setting for this film is very unconventional, at least for the 90's. Through excellent film-making, I can see why Society felt the need to operate in such a ruthless fashion, in order to protect itself from Ellen and what she represented to Newland, its newly crowned prince.<br /><br />Over the past few months, I have also grown an appreciation for Winona Ryder's performance as May. She is a shrewd politician, who uses her ""bright blindness"" as a megaphone for Society's rules of conduct, a weapon of manipulation against her destined husband Newland, and as a way to continue plotting without easily being detected.<br /><br />I wonder how many more times I will watch ""The Age of Innocence"" before I risk being exposed to Hollywood's 21st century conformity, such as ""Independence Day"" or ""Wild, Wild West"". All I know is that Ellen Olenska (as one of my favorite cinematic heroines) serves to validate my own sense of individuality, and neither she nor the astonishing beauty of this Scorcese creation, will ever be boring. 10 out of 10 stars.",Plot,Performance,
"Popular French art/cult director Jean Rollin's first foray into the horror genre calls itself a two-part melodrama and is divided into two segments that overlap; ""Part One: The Rape of the Vampire"" and ""Part Two: The Vampire Women."" In the first portion (which is the shorter of the two), psychoanalyst Thomas, his friend Marc and Marc's girlfriend Brigitte go to a mansion to investigate claims of vampirism. Living at the large country home are four psychologically troubled young women who are rumored to be ageless vampires by the superstitious townspeople. The villagers try to keep the women inside at all times by staking crosses everywhere and using a weird-looking, hairy-faced scarecrow that an old man provides the voice for. Thomas suspects the women have been brainwashed into believing they're actually vampires when it fact they're not, and sets out to get to the bottom of things. Even though the acting's not great, the dialogue is terrible and the editing is horrible, this segment is visually very beautiful. The images, the camera set-ups, the framing of shots and the clarity of the black-and-white photography are all done well. The director also proves to have a nice eye for detail, outdoor scenery, light and shadow. The art direction is also good, and though the storyline is a bit muddled it's still not too difficult to follow. Unfortunately, immediately after this shorter portion concludes, the film basically falls apart and it never recovers.<br /><br />With several of the principals either dead or turned into vampires at the end of ""Rape,"" we now enter the second segment ""The Queen of the Vampires."" The ""Queen"" is an arrogant short-haired woman who is carried around on a bed by two of her goons and has a bunch of hipster followers at her side to do her bidding. No clue what she really wants or what's driving her, but it seems like she's power mad and wants to put on some kind of theatrical wedding where two people will have sex in a coffin that's nailed shut. She and her minions have also blackmailed a doctor into trying to come up with a cure for vampirism. They have turned the doctor's girlfriend into a vampire to edge him along. Several characters from the first segment wander in and out every once in awhile. It's all extremely confusing to watch and hard to keep track of what's going on, who is who and what it is whoever is trying to accomplish. This second and much longer portion also seems more rushed and less stylish than the first. It's also full of continuity errors and hacky editing splices that make it even more confusing. Both segments feature plenty of T&A shots, which were quite risqué for 1967 I'm sure.<br /><br />Discounting Rollin's super-cheesy living dead disaster ZOMBIE LAKE (which even his most devoted fans have a hard time defending), this is my first real look at the work of this director. I see a fantastic visual stylist with a lot of potential who needs a little help on his narrative structure and pacing. A happy medium can be met. Throwing a little clarity in every once in awhile never hurt a film. Of course, some people can and will defend the most senseless films ever made as long as they look good, calling them ""poetic"" or ""dream-like"" or ""experimental."" That's perfectly fine if this is a masterpiece in some people's eyes, but to me a movie this illogical really needs to sustain that other-worldly feel throughout to keep me interested. The first segment almost seemed to hit the right note, but the second didn't even come close. I'll certainly still check out more films from Rollin based on the positives here even though I was less than enthusiastic about this effort.",Plot,,
"<br /><br />This is the latest in the Toho Films series, and it should be noted that this movie is a GODZILLA movie, a genre unto itself. Not only is it an intelligent film, with likeable characters ( the Godzilla Prediction Unit is great, in the enthusiasm of scientists trying to understand Godzilla as a force of nature; besides that, who wouldn't want to be part of the GDU and have that cool Godzilla logo on the side of their transport vehicle? ) and a truly kinetic, enthusiastic script by Hiroshi Kashiwabara and Wataru Mimura--the most telling line of dialogue in the movie, which could be used to describe the love and respect the writers have, occurs when a television reporter comments that the entire proceeding is ""like something out of a 1950s science fiction film.""<br /><br />And that is the point of this movie, to remind every one of us who grew up on monster movies that in the midst of all the ALIEN-stylized cinematic drool, that the giant UFO perched menacingly over Tokyo, shimmering with mysterious electronic pulsations while Godzilla ( with an underwater swimming scene for Godzilla that is priceless) stomps in for a classic samauri-like duel with the alien craft and its occupant, with all the Man In Suit and b-movie special effects you can stand, is the reason why many of us ""creature feature"" lovers continue going to the movies TODAY, because we're looking for something like GODZILLA 2000. A movie crafted with exquisite passion and respect, both for its subject and for its audience.<br /><br />Go see this movie in a theatre, or be sorry you didn't. Thrill to the magnificent musical score (the best I've heard in a film this year), and the superior direction that provides Godzilla with power and heroism (yes, heroism; Godzilla's reasons for alternately destroying Tokyo, but fighting against alien forces to save it, demonstrates what all us monster freaks know: Godzilla is intelligent, and has his reasons). I dare you to go and see Godzilla blast away with his atomic breath and not be ready to come up out of your seat with joy.

"Finally after watching Marauding Mothers, Diabolical Daddies, Wicked Sisters, Jonesin' Uncles and Perverted Twins, I arrived at Rabid Grannies. It didn't totally live up to the hype as being 10 times the movie Diabolical Daddies is but it was still pretty good.<br /><br />Ya got the two grannies, who are actually aunties, who are filthy rich and throwing a birthday party for themselves, with the rest of their immediate family celebrating it with them. Well all seems to be going just divine until a weird lady with a gift shows up. The gift is actually from.....I forget the guy's relation....maybe cousin. Whatever. Well, this present holds a hideous surprise that turns this lil box-social into a full on bloodbath. Woohoo! <br /><br />Rabid Grannies is a wacky friggin flick. It's got a really silly (too much sometimes) attitude and loads of fantastic make-up and gore effects that combine together to make a seriously memorable flick which should be mentioned more in hor/com discussion.<br /><br />Most surprisingly about the flick, is it's creativity. There are some creepy scenes mixed with a sly almost cartoony humor that gels in a pretty unique way. There's one scene with the aunts (grannies) and a priest that is really just out there. One aunt is giving him the opportunity to off himself, while the other is telling him to fight for his life. It's really just a cool friggin scene that really had me smiling.<br /><br />Even though the dialog is sometimes overly hammy, and the dubbing kinda crappy, it kinda makes the movie's ridiculous charm that much more noticeable. Which could be a good thing or bad thing, but for this guy's taste for crazy sh!t, it's a great thing. Would go nice as a double feature with Demon Knight.",Plot,,
"This is just another example of the continuing downward spiral of Eddie Murphy's once exciting career. Murphy will always have scripts handed to him and he'll always be working in films but the once edgy comedian has lost his edge a long time ago. This story takes place in the future where Earth has populated the Moon and a former smuggler named Pluto Nash (Murphy) takes over a nightclub from a friend and Nash makes it a big success and moneymaker. A young woman and aspiring singer named Dina Lake (Rosario Dawson) asks for a job but all Nash gives her is the opportunity to waitress. Some mobsters have been buying up the local business's and they want Nash's club but he won't sell. So they blow the place up and try to kill him but Nash, Dina and a robot named Bruno (Randy Quaid) escape and the mobsters try and find him. This film was directed by Ron Underwood who is usually reliable with lightweight comedy like this but this film fails from the outset. The special effects are adequate but not overly impressive. Many of the scenes are clearly filmed on a soundstage and in one shot Underwood resorts to actors being hoisted by wires for the gravity effect. Didn't they stop doing that in the 60's? And poor Randy Quaid has to play a horny and overly sensitive robot. Were we really suppose to find it amusing that he tries to get it on with other robots? But the big flaw comes from Murphy himself. This once exciting comedian use to be so reliable for edgy performances but here he plays his character totally straight. As you watch this you keep waiting for Murphy to say something witty and off the cuff but it never happens. It looks like Murphy has decided to try and be an action star or be the romantic lead. Murphy has become boring to watch and its sad to watch his films now. Pam Grier pops up as Murphy's mother but she has nothing to do. She has maybe two scenes and then she runs off (Literally).

"My hat is truly off to anyone who has the commitment to get off of the couch and actually make a movie. It is an enormous undertaking. But the gushing reviews listed elsewhere were so contrary to my own experience that I felt compelled to offer another point of view. This film seemed to appear in the newspaper listings with no publicity so I researched it in advance on IMDb. The background information pointed clearly toward ""Mormon cinema"". The problem with the genre is that it leans on the inside joke and preaches to the choir to the exclusion of the broader audience. The LDS references were frequent and heavy-handed. To my ear, the main character's accent sounds more like Alabama than Montana. And how could anyone not know after even the most superficial first-date small talk that he was getting involved with his boss's grand-daughter?

I guess that it may not translate outside of Britain due to the characters involved?<br /><br />Next film Paddy/Meadows please. Recommended.,Performance,Plot,
"Two or even three movies for the price of one! The first is a travelog that was shot somewhere south of the US border. There are some excellent scenes of local fishermen and the culture of ordinary folks. Rumor has it that these are from Orsen Wells circa 1942. The second movie is unabashed marketing for tourism in Mexico - the last shot is of a tourist poster that melts into a plane flying to or from our neighbor to the south. The third movie is a lackluster mystery of sorts with Tom Lawrence at his worst. It is not that all of his Falcon movies are terrible, some are decent. The Falcon in Mexico is not one of his stellar performances and not really worth your time viewing. Half an hour after the movie, you won't rember who did it or care.

"Storytelling has two parts. Fiction and non fiction. In fiction Tod Solondz tells us how we have to watch part two, as soon as you start writing (filming in this case) everything becomes fiction. It is not surprising that the first part (fiction) seems to be more non-fiction than part 2 (non-fiction). The first part is the very raw and painful story about a young girl who is raped by her literature teacher. The second part is the story of a documentaire filmmaker who tries to make a film about teens in suburbia. The guy is a looser, and nobody believes his film will be succesful. But the family he follows (by accident) gets involved in a serie of dramatic events, and the film becomes a hit. When the filmmaker tells his subject he is sory for what happend to him, scooby tells him not to be sorry, because his film is a hit.<br /><br />Tod Solondz is a genial storyteller. He doesn't follow the normal structure of a hollywood film, a protagonist with an dramatic purpose, an antagonsist with an invert purpose, ... Like the bad guy in part one tells us, the second story is way better, this one has at least a begin, a middle and an end. In fact Non-fiction has a begin, a middle and an end, but that is not the reason why you will like the movie. The dramatic events that will happen to the family livingstone are not the motor that makes this movie turn. As in happiness, it is the way Tod Solondz shows us how we really act in life, different than how we think we are acting. watching a Tod solondz movie is like when you watch yourself in the mirror early in the morning when you aren't completely awake. there is an ocean between where i live, an where tod Solondz films his movies, but everytime again, i see myself reflected in the personages of Tod Solondz. That is wath makes his films so wonderful painful, you see people doing stupid things, but you can't blame them, because you know you should do the same thing. You love the personages you are laughing with.<br /><br />Well, i love Tod Solondz, in my directors all-time ranking i'll put him on the same level as lars Von Trier, just under Ingmar Bergman, and igmar bergman, that is the top.",Plot,,
"The first thing my dad did when the credits were done rolling (do stay through the end of the credits because they don't tie up a storyline until then), was to pat me on the back and say thank you for pushing him to come see Aaja Nachle because he hadn't seen such a good film in a long time. Not counting Omkara, this was probably the best film I've seen this year. It was uplifting and beautifully done, especially the Laila-Majnu part, which I wanted to watch again. Madhuri (who I was too young to appreciate in her hey-day) was vivacious and elegant and seeing her dancing and her expressions were such a treat. She's surrounded by the stalwarts of Hindi parallel cinema- Raghubir Yadav, Irrfan Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ranvir Shorey, Vinay Pathak, etc, and I won't even bother saying anything about Akshaye Khanna because I'm just too damn biased. The plot drew from stories that have been around since the beginning of cinema. It's cute and inspiring and it appealled to me more than Chak De India because of the dance/theatre aspect of it. I think Anil Mehta did a wonderful job. As I was leaving the theatre, everyone kept saying how wonderful it was, and that oddly made me feel proud because I think this a truly non-conformist film and if it does well, which it should, it does completely on it's own merit, not because of star-power (Madhuri excluded), gimmicks, or because it's part of some trend. So, do go see it!",Performance,Plot,
"I never saw the exposition of life like this in any movie as it goes on behind the curtains in the ghetto, and this movie showed me a small portion of just that. The ugly reality of life came to surface in this film. Typically black men in the ghetto don't show much respect toward women, abuse them on a regular basis for their selfish, immoral and degraded sexual perversions, as hinted, behind closed doors. I felt both surprised and disturbed by the portrayal of the conscienceless, shifty, two-faced and shameless men who very well painted the picture of life and the kind of men one would meet in the hellish world of drug abuse, prostitution, and poverty. In the end, we learn that there is a way out of there for all, but with a large price tag attached to it!",Plot,,
"I love this movie. Although some people may classify it as ""dated,"" the concepts that it deals with are worth exploring today. How honest are we to one another? How often do we actually look at people? And what is love?<br /><br />From its opening shots (tooling up PCH in a cool car) to its closing ones (people really looking at each other), it's a true work of art. The beginning truly captures the free and concept-expanding atmosphere that is the Esalen Institute, which itself has not changed much since then. Screen goddess Natalie Wood, in one of her best roles, inhabits the honesty and sexual freedom that is Carol. Robert Culp is a strong counterpart to her as Bob. The more repressed couple, Eliott Gould and Dyan Cannon, are perfect.<br /><br />Along the way, they explore the boundaries of sexuality, monogamy and friendship, and realize that some lines are better left uncrossed. To me, it puts a very fine point on what was going on in the 60s, and where exactly we went wrong.<br /><br />SEE THIS FILM. It'll give you insight. Promise.",Directional Techniques,Plot,

It's good to see that any schlub can now get his message out there rather than all the power in the hands of the elite. That being said, why anyone would have such a fixation on a human being they hardly know was disturbing. I'm glad that Drew Barrymore didn't seemed bothered by it, maybe she was relieved as she might have felt this guy wasn't a potential danger to her after meeting him.

"This movie was a bit of a bore. I walked in rather neutral with my expectations, and after the first 10 minutes realized that this ball of cheese was not for me. I sat through it all, for the sake of the company I was with.<br /><br />Mandy Moore and John Krasinski are cute, but very flat characters. There is little or no character development in this film. Robin Williams as Reverend Frank tries to save the show with his humorous antics, but was unfortunately cliché in his attempts. The little boy, Josh Flitter, does an excellent job as the annoyingly forthright ""minister in training"", as do the other children playing minor roles, but the overall attempt was bland.<br /><br />The movie neither humorously avoids morals, nor does it end with moral enlightenment. The ""lesson"" in the end is weak and predictable.<br /><br />If you're looking for something heartwarming, inspiring, or thought-provoking, turn elsewhere. If you'd like a few cheap laughs with a weak storyline, this could be your film.<br /><br />I rate it a 2 out of 10.",Performance,Plot,

They've earned it. But it's not like this movie is really that good or anything. It's screwy and fun, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't quite. I especially liked Brad Pitt, probably because he's the only one showing some new colors here. It's like he started from scratch and built this guy from experiences he once had in high school.<br /><br />""Burn After Reading"" passes the time, but don't build this up too much, because it's mostly just a whole lot of goofing around that just holds itself together because of the talents of the Coens.",Others,,

"I read the director said he made this movie because he wanted to restore Jim Dougherty's place in history. Of course, if his first wife hadn't become you-know-who, he wouldn't even be a blip on the radar.<br /><br />All of her biographers have noted that Monroe was furious when Dougherty told Photoplay in 1953 that she was so in love with him, she threatened to jump off the Santa Monica Pier if he left her. Little wonder how she'd react to his claims that he created ""Marilyn Monroe;"" that she was forced to divorce him; and, even when she was the biggest star in the world, she yearned to return to him. How do I put this? Hogwash! Not only is there no evidence they stayed in contact, according to the 8/6/62 New York Times, when her ""dedicated friend for life"" was informed of her death, he merely said ""I'm sorry,"" and didn't attend her funeral.<br /><br />He also makes another claim: that he created S.W.A.T.

"The Rosenbergs are poster children for the black and white horror of what became known as the McCarthy Era, the Communist Witch Hunts, of the early '50s. Their faces, especially Ethel's, is as recognizable to us as McCarthy's himself. Ivy Meeropol, their granddaughter, grew up with an activist father who believed that his parents were, as they said repeatedly and even at their deaths in the electric chair, innocent. Her home was filled with their images, from newspaper accounts, books, and newsreel footage stills, to pieces of art created by the likes of Picasso. But this film only makes passing reference, I feel, to the fact of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. What it does do is present us with a granddaughter's rather guileless investigation of who her family are. Her own name was changed by her father's adoption by another family since his own grandparents, aunts, and uncles--on both sides--Greenglass and Rosenberg-- would not take the two orphaned boys in. Her cousins (one of whom she meets for the first time and who weeps with shame at how his own father--Julius's brother--changed their name to Roberts and refused to even see his two nephews) are complete strangers to her. What does she find out? Does she know her grandparents better? I doubt it. She can't know why the Rosenbergs chose to die rather than betray political beliefs, friends, and their nearly religious conviction that Socialism was humankind's only hope. What she can see is what shame, fear, cowardice, infamy, and love does to a family. I think Lillian Hellman's title for her memoir of the same period names it best: Scoundrel Time. After all, the Rosenbergs' convictions and executions made Roy Cohn into a celebrity. God help us.",Plot,,
"What a low level things sometimes fell to during the War! To think that such a worthless exercise as this could even be contemplated, much less filmed! James Mason is supposed to be a Frenchman named Raoul, but his French accent is something a ten year-old in a school play would find embarrassing. Thank goodness he dies before the end, none too soon! Michael Wilding is even more ridiculous. He plays someone who owns a cafe in Normandy, but he speaks with a Cockney accent and acts like a clown. As for Roland Culver, he ambles through this film as if he were on a golfing holiday, occasionally wrinkling his brow in order to suggest he may have thought of something, and once in a while uttering a platitude to remind us that this is a talkie (or perhaps to wake the audience up). What passes for a plot is about some jolly chaps going off to Normandy from Britain, to be beastly to the Germans and find out how to win the war by discovering where some things are which might be blown up, dontcha know. Their idea of hiding from the Germans is to leap behind a false bush and leave their legs showing. The dunderheads in helmets who rush by with fixed bayonets are unable to see legs showing behind false bushes, so that's all right, then.

I wondered why, with two such great stars as Gene Kelly and Deanna Durbin, I had never heard of this movie before. So I ordered it...I watched it....and now I know why I 've never heard of it before. It is terrible. It is the worst performance ever, in the careers of both Gene and Deanna. And, as other reviewers have said, it has absolutely NOTHING to do with Christmas...nor is it a musical. Gene doesn't dance a single step, and the only time Deanna sings is when she is expressing undying passionate love for this vicious, psychopathic murderer she is married to. <br /><br />In the opening scene, we are introduced to two military men having a conversation about the upcoming nuptials of one of them. We grow to like these two men, and I felt cheated, because one of them we never see again, and the other, the engaged one, merely serves for the rest of the movie as a body for Deanna to tell her story to. In this scene we learn that he is taking military leave to visit his fiancé, when he receives a ""Dear John"" letter saying she has married someone else. He is devastated, and plans to go back home anyway to confront her. Due to bad weather, the plan has to stop in New Orleans, where he meets Deanna in a sleazy night club. The proprietor is the enchanting Gladys George. Deanna tells him (and us) how she met Gene...they were sitting next to each other at a symphony concert. She was captivated by his shy, ""aw shucks"" demeanor. They married and moved in with his very strange mother, played by Gale Sondergard, who horror movie fans will know very well. Gene and Gale are the creepiest mother & son team since Sante and Kenneth Kimes.<br /><br />The are blissfully married for 6 months. All of a sudden, he starts displaying signs of criminal behavior, and starts abusing Deanna...but still she stands by him! Before you know it, the police come looking for him, and he is on trial for murder. Deanna and Mom sit together in the courtroom, and when the guilty verdict is read, Mom turns to Deanna, slaps her in the face and declares her responsible for sonny going to jail. Needless to say, she kicks her out of the house.<br /><br />Now Deanna has to find work, so she gets a job singing at Gladys George's sleazy nightclub. Eventually, Gene escapes from prison and hides out in the nightclub to kill Deanna, because he assumes since she's working there, that she must be sleeping with all the patrons.

Michael summons the lethal and evil spirit of Virgil, who takes possession of Tony's body and starts bumping off Michael's friends. Writer/director Ruben Galindo, Jr. trots out all the expected endearingly hokey 80's teen fright feature clichés: we've got a couple of false scares, a corny lovey dovey montage set to infectiously bouncy 80's rock music, a generic spooky'n'shuddery ominous score by Pedro Plascencia Salinas, a tasteful make-out scene, and even the always amusing psycho in the back seat of a car bit. Moreover, the basic plot blatantly emulates the second ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie, the pace really kicks into gear and rarely lets up after the rather leisurely opening third, the 80's clothes and hairstyles are hilariously hideous (Michael's silly blue pajamas are especially sidesplitting!), and Galindo, Jr. gleefully pours on the blood by the gallon with several pleasingly brutal murder set pieces. Additional accolades are in order for the mostly sound acting from the personable cast. The stunningly gorgeous and adorable Gabriela Hassle in particular impresses with her warm and charming performance as Michael's sweet gal pal Alexandra.

"Crazy Love is a little known eighties cult film that traces a boy's life through three key events. The film is Belgian produced; based around three stories by cult writer Charles Bukowski and brought to life by Belgian director Dominique Deruddere. Crazy Love does not have a particularly good reputation these days, although it apparently caused quite a stir upon its release and that isn't all that surprising considering the subject matter; although to be honest, nothing in this film particularly shocked or offended me. The central character is Harry Voss, who we first meet as a young kid who is learning about sex from his friend, with the aide of a few loose women. We then pick up a few years later and Henry is a schoolboy, befallen by an extreme case of acne that leads to him being rejected by the opposite sex and ridiculed by his peers. The third and final chapter sees the once bright young boy as a drunken waster who cuts a stark contrast to the boy we saw in both the first and second chapters of the film.<br /><br />The three parts of the film are all incredibly different and the director succeeds in creating an atmosphere to carry this off. Crazy Love is a 'coming of age' film; a favourite subject among Hollywood 'cookie cutter' filmmakers, but this one is about as far from the mainstream as you can get. The first segment is the lightest of the three, but still packs a punch as we watch the subject discovering sex and eventually getting acquainted with his hand. The second segment focuses more on the idea of teenage alienation and sees the film take a darker turn as the sensitive young man is rejected by all the girls because of his deforming acne. This provides a nice opener to the third section, which is completely dark and dismal and probably what earned the film its reputation - the ending is not something that many will forget in a hurry! Overall, it's not really surprising that this film hasn't gone down as an all time 'classic, but it certainly has its place among cult fans and that isn't surprising either. Be sure to catch this film if you want something a bit different!",Plot,,
"Vet Hard, the debut of the 25 year old director Tim Oliehoek, is a definite thrill. Throughout the entire movie, you will be bombarded with nasty, but pretty effective jokes, loads of one liners and all sorts of other fun n weird stuff.<br /><br />The characters are also pretty wacky, ranging from a fat woman hating tough guy, to a necrophiliac serial killer. Even though we do not really get involved with these characters, its hardly an annoyance, as the movie is pretty much focused on the action scenes. These scenes have been done very well, especially for a dutch movie, some might even say that a certain chase in this movie, has the same sort of excitement level, as amsterdamned once had with the speedboat chase. Again, even though there is a lot more heavier stuff coming from Hollywood, for dutch standards, its pretty wild.<br /><br />The story isn't very original as well, yet its brought with such enthusiasm and you can see that the actors all had a great time. The little cameos of a lot of dutch celebs is fun as well, and are guaranteed some laughs.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this film, as it is one of the better dutch comedies and features some great and hilarious (action) scenes.<br /><br />Regarding the director Tim Oliehoek, i think we will be seeing a lot more from this guy!",Performance,Directional Techniques,

Phantom of Liberty for the most part is quite a normal film with a structured narrative and some quite well defined characters What makes it brilliant is the fact that one minute, its just a normal film and then a scene where a family sit at a table on toilet seats is thrown at us. Followed by each family member coming to another room to eat on their own. Distorting reality. Weird! Some parts of the film are so absurd they are funny. Such as an early scene where some parents look at pictures and deem them 'disgusting' when they are just pictures of buildings. Its very strange and humorous in general.<br /><br />The are minimal cuts in the camera work, shots flow together nicely. For example a two shot may not cut to an over the shoulder shot, but just adjust to it. A technique which I liked.<br /><br />I found this film to be quite oddly lit. Is often dark and light is used kind of sparingly. Odd, as the film sometimes almost looks like shades of grey through its darkness.<br /><br />I'm guessing that the criterion version is the way to go, I saw a version taped from TV about 6 years ago, which was at times fuzzy and grainy.

In fact, the whole film looks like one big bore with David Gale looking like he's sleepwalking through the whole thing. He made a better ham in the RE-ANIMATOR series and the injecting of the green fluid into his neck is a silly cue from those earlier films. <br /><br />Never heard of any of the rest of the cast except for Melanie Shatner as the receptionist, and that's only because she's Bill's daughter.<br /><br />The Elite DVD has a short clip of David Gale visiting Japan in order to help promote this film, which I understand, was a big hit over there. Why, I don't know. Maybe they thought the creature was 'cute' or something.<br /><br />It might've worked better if Roger Corman had a hand in it, but as it stands, it only gets a charitable failure.<br /><br />2 out of 10<br /><br />",Performance,Plot,

"This film works on many levels. What's odd is that one place it is weak in is the plot - it does somewhat tie it all up and make sense but my main point is it doesnt really matter - the director set out to make a scary ghost story and that it is! I see horror films from all over the world so I am pretty jaded when it comes to something ""scaring"" me but this film has many sequences that truly are frightening and disturbing. Some of the images have stayed with me for weeks. The lighting, the art direction and the use of muted colors (aside from reds used effectively)all make up for a creepy, eerie visual. I have to laugh at the arrogance of some of the comments on this and other ""horror"" films that claim since it didnt scare them the film is NOT SCARY. That is b.s. What scares one person may not scare another. You can say the piece didn't scare you but to make such a sweeping statement is vain. I personally didn't like any of the Friday of 13th movies, but obviously those films work on some level for millions of people. This film is so non-American in it's pace and core that that is what might turn off some viewers, but that's what I loved about it. The director just sets up the camera and keeps it on a space and then has things slowly emerge from the sides - he has you start to look and scope and wonder if you are REALLY seeing something as opposed to the lazy, bloated SHOCK moment of most US horror films. There are moments when people are confronted by visions/images of ghosts that move and terrorize just like real dreams - slow movements, awkward movements as the ghost approaches you. Terrifying. The film definitely doesn't know how to wrap it all up but in many ways, I found this film even scarier than the original RING. Well made ghost story.

"This is a well-cast, well-directed, tightly-scripted film (only 87 minutes). The cast is amazing for what had to be a fairly low budget RKO picture from the mid-1950's; Randolph Scott was an established star while Forrest Tucker, J. Carrol Naish, and Denver Pyle were all established, talented Western performers and Edgar Buchanan was one of the best Western character actors of all time. What hurts the movie severely and is its major flaw is the setting. Nothing about one single shot of the film looks anything like Southern Indiana or anywhere else in the Midwest, and exactly like California, where it was actually shot. This lack of authenticity is distracting, in some scenes more than others, but never completely destroys the fine performances. Like some of the others, I would like to know more about the historical Reno Brothers and how closely this film represents their true story; I'm sure that it's somewhat closer than Elvis' ''Love Me Tender'', which is about the same topic and came out the next year.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques

The only noted actor in the film was Steiger, and his performance certainly was not his best, but the movie was still very good. Overall, I thought that it reflected the futility of war through the struggles of these three characters very well, inserting comedy where appropriate.

"This film is often compared with Dances With Wolves, which is certainly understandable, but personally I feel that Black Robe is the better film, both in terms of art and fidelity to historical fact. I am a history graduate student in New York currently teaching an undergraduate class in the Bronx on early U.S. history, and Black Robe is just about the only film I have no hesitation showing to my students.<br /><br />As a portrait of life in New France (now Eastern Canada) in the early to mid-1600s--when Samuel de Champlain was the leader of the tiny French outpost of Quebec--this film is virtually flawless. The complex relations between ordinary French colonists (almost all male), French Jesuit priests, and Native American tribes in the region (primarily Algonquian, which is a very broad category encompassing many distinct tribes) are rendered with a wonderful degree of accuracy, at least in my opinion. Colonists in New France generally took greater care than other Europeans--particularly the Spanish and the English--to have amicable relations with native people's they encountered. This is evident from the film but is not overemphasized, as we see the obvious conflicts between the French and their nominal Indian allies.<br /><br />Black Robe's take on religion during this time period is smart, and illustrates some of the similarities between native and European beliefs while demonstrating the latter's contempt for native religion (the main character--""Black Robe,"" a term many Algonquians used both in the movie and in historical fact to describe the French Jesuit priests--is the primary example here). The Native Americans we encounter in this film are not portrayed in some idealized, pre-historic fashion, but rather as complex, violence-prone tribes as was actually the case. This does not diminish our sympathy for them and the difficulties they face as a result of the arrival of Europeans--as it should not--and instead actually shows the great extent to which Native Americans in early colonial history had power and affected the course of events.<br /><br />I write this review mainly as a student of history, but in terms of the art of cinema I think Black Robe is also excellent. The film is beautifully shot, and the characters are drawn with a fair amount of complexity. It is a very ""un-Hollywood"" film (being Canadian) which probably partially explains why it succeeds. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this period (the ""American"" colonies during the 1600s) or anyone who was intrigued by films like Dances With Wolves or Last of the Mohicans. This film has no big stars or Hollywood-style love story (such as the one that made Last of the Mohicans essentially unbearable to watch) but it does a great job presenting the complex dynamic between Native Americans and Europeans during the colonial period. Serious students of history (including teachers looking to show a film about Native-European relations) will find much to appreciate in Black Robe, and I think anyone who likes an interesting film even if it does not have famous actors in it will as well.",Visual Effect,Directional Techniques,Performance

"Beware! This poor excuse for a movie is neither a remake of George A. Romero's Day of the Dead, nor is it a sequel to the decent remake of Dawn of the Dead. Oh sure, people who like it and the director himself will tell you it's a remake of the classic, but not a single speck of the original remains. Instead, it is another ""for dumb teens only"" horror picture that lacks any real scares, is laden with awful clichés and ultimately fails because it bares the name and thus, seemingly tries to live up to the standards set by the infinitely better ""original"". The producers saw the opportunity to put a big name on a small (figuratively speaking) movie in efforts to grab some cash and did so without any regard for how it would effect the finished product.<br /><br />This film is awful, make no mistake - but had it not set people up to see a remake of a classic it may have passed at least as a mildly entertaining failure as opposed to a total waste of time that is offensive to it's own genre.

"Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific. It's hard to believe that anybody other than John Cusack would have put money into this. With a string of anti-military/anti-war movies already being destroyed at the box office, it's almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script.<br /><br />At first, it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack(s) all over again. But only about 90 seconds into the movie, it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at DR STRANGELOVE.<br /><br />I liked so many of Cusacks movies that I thought I would risk seeing the DVD of this one. I have to say that I don't know if Cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it.

Watching Sun-hwa go from the most innocent girl into the call girl that she becomes makes your heart break but then watching how she begins to feel about the Bad Guy at the end tempers this a little.

Yet, despite his exemplary talent and popularity, his list of movies is pathetically small, which can be attributed to two factors - racism and politics. How sad because Paul Robeson was undoubtedly one of the major figures in U. S. entertainment history and if one wants to know why, one just has to watch the movie Proud Valley, directed by Pen Tennyson. Here Paul Robeson plays a role that transcends the ludicrously ridiculous racial stereotypes that Hollywood wanted Mr. Robeson to play. Imagine for a moment, my friends, Paul Robeson playing a shuffling, mumbling sycophant. An outrage! Yet this is exactly the kind of silly roles that Hollywood would have had Mr. Robeson play if he had so chosen. That he starred in such movies as Show Boat and The Emperor Jones was due in large part to the fact that these films were directed by British directors who truly appreciated Mr. Robeson's talents. In Proud Valley, Robeson delivers an outstanding performance as a miner who makes the ultimate sacrifice so that others may live. The story may seem contrived, but it isn't. The movie is neither sensationalistic or melodramatic.

"Early Kurosawa masterpiece; arguably, his first. *Stray Dog* grabs your attention immediately, with the superbly weird close-ups of the mangy dog panting behind the opening credits. Following the credits, the director delivers a clinic on the art of montage, utilizing quick nonlinear cutting that makes the narrative get straight to the point: ashamed rookie cop (an impossibly young Toshiro Mifune) explaining to his boss that he lost his gun; then a jump back to earlier in the day during target practice; then a quick cut to a scene on a crowded city bus in which the Colt gets lifted. Properly impatient with exposition, Kurosawa has his editor wield the cutting knife with ruthless precision. Only after the premise is established does the movie slow down.<br /><br />Indeed, *Stray Dog* tends to meander during the next two hours. There's a famous 8-minute sequence in which Mifune, going undercover in search of his gun, wanders through the detritus (human and otherwise) of a black-market underworld in bombed-out post-War Tokyo. These 8 minutes contain zero exposition, containing instead some stunning on-location montage from 2nd-unit guy Honda (who directed *Godzilla* later) that unabashedly turns into scathing social commentary, and this, in the final analysis, is far more interesting than the catch-as-catch-can plot about a rookie detective's stolen gun. Owing stylistic and thematic debts to old Eisenstein pictures as well as then-current trends in Italian cinema, Kurosawa fashions his own polemic about post-War Japan that can't help but fascinate historians. Those of us in the West who have our own perceptions about what Japan is like (the stereotype is that it's a spiffy country inhabited by spiffy people) will be shocked at the filthy conditions and depravity glimpsed at in this footage. It's a land in a time and a place where women steal pistols for criminals in order to score rice-ration cards.<br /><br />The movie is ultimately about how a person maintains a sense of morality in such conditions. Mifune's cop is, after all, not too different from the psychopath whom he pursues: both are veterans in their late twenties who ended up on entirely different paths which have suddenly converged. One reviewer below complained about Kurosawa's ""facile humanism"" (how can humanism be ""facile""?), but I rather call it a heroic humanism. Mifune is an honorable young man who chooses to be a hero: after all, it would've been easier to quit the force after enduring the shame of getting his gun stolen, and it certainly would've been easier to roam the black-markets like his antagonist Yusa and generally cave in to psychopathy. Kurosawa is suggesting that if a man (or a nation) chooses the right path, redemption can be found. Not for the last time, Kurosawa makes heroism and simple decency thrilling to watch.<br /><br />All in all, *Stray Dog* is a landmark achievement for Kurosawa and for cinema in general. It stands proudly beside his more famous achievements in the decade that followed. 8 stars out of 10.",Directional Techniques,Plot,

This movie is begging to be loved by people who love the gross and the absurd and it's all too obvious. Besides, ""Street Trash"" never seems to get anywhere. It starts of with a guy farting in another guy's face, then some guy's literally melting away and we think, okay, that's what the movie's going to be about. Then this storyline is completely abandoned and for hours and hours (or so it seems) we witness the everday life of a bunch of bums who live in little self made flats at a car dump. Obviously, for most parts this movie isn't meant seriously (there's a hilarious Robert DeNiro-like character called Nick Duran who curses in a ridiculously rude manner and who even gets to sing his own little song when the credits roll) but on the other hand the makers also seemed eager to gain the respect of horror audiences. As a horror movie ""Street Trash"" falls flat on its face. The gore effects are nicely done and there's interesting steady cam work to be found here (I hear the director went on to work for James Cameron), but the epic length and the stupid plot of this film prevent this from being a success. If you just have a casual interest in the genre, avoid ""Street Trash"" at all costs and even if you're a die hard-fan think twice about watching it. Sitting this one through really is a toughie.",Plot,Visual Effect,

"Poor De Sade, persecuted and imprisoned in his lifetime, misrepresented after his death, and unlike one-time-fellow-prisoner Laclos, author of Dangerous Liaisons, is persecuted and tortured on film. Appalling cinematography, grating music, atrocious acting, and a director who praised Palance's what-was-he-thinking turn and despised the very presence of Power as Justine, although she was almost the only one who wasn't mugging in every scene. What was Mercedes McCambridge on? Dear Klaus Kinski, no wonder he spends his time running desperately from one set of bars to the other: ""Get me out of this movie! I'm trapped in it forever!"" They even removed his vocal cords. Still, a few points for Power's sweet breasts and eyes, and some other brief anatomical contributions by others.

"Personally,I didn't see a single boom shot in the whole extravaganza.There were some shots that were incredibly out of focus,but it turned out they were deliberate choices by the filmmakers.Parts of this film are actually wickedly funny,as all horror films should be.I couldn't help thinking though while watching this film that it might have actually been quite terrifying if the babies just looked like real babies!",Directional Techniques,,
"When actor/director Edward Burn's The Brothers McMullan was released back in 1995, the critics likened it to a Woody Allen comedy. Now it seems that Mr Burns has brazenly gone one step further and remade Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives (1992) with slight plot changes and a younger cast of characters and of course an alternate title. Somehow this rewrite fails to capture the zany spark of the original, which is an excellent movie (try watching both movies back to back). Perhaps the only noteworthy thing about this movie are the performances: Rosario Dawson is excellent as the teacher who gets pregnant after a one night stand. As a matter a fact, her performance is the only thing that redeems this movie, since all the other characters are caught up in full Woody Allen film mimicry mode, some perhaps unintentionally. It's a shame that Mr Burns didn't run with the pregnant-after-a-one-night-stand plot thread as he might have turned out a movie of more merit and certainly one of more originality. 4/10 for effort minus 2 for borrowing heavily from another director. Shame on you, Edward Burns!",Performance,,
"One of those movies where one looks at everyone involved with the film and thinks a surefire hit but it isn't. Really just a series of skits about carrying on in the English way after a nuclear attack, the film never connects in any way with the viewer. Originally a play by Spike Milligan, I have a feeling that on paper the movie would seem hilarious and though a couple of scenes translate well (the tube train that keeps running even though no one needs it and the wedding) most of the skits fall flat. I, for one, cringed every time Marty Feldman appeared wearing a nurses uniform. Maybe part of the problem is that the film is definitely targeted towards a British audience and since I'm American, I don't get it but I think that even the English would find it dated today.",Directional Techniques,,

A few weeks later I bought the game and played like a mad man.<br /><br />During the time I've spent playing this game I can honestly say that it's a great game for fantasy and strategy lovers. It evolves around a very cool and handy system where it's very easy to get accompanied by people in younger ages due to the very basic system of the game, which is actually great.<br /><br />The storyline was somewhat complex for me, but others might have the experience to understand it. But the gaming experience was awesome. Heroes is probably the first game which contains a system in strategy you might not have seen before. The graphics are very nice.

"Director David Lynch refuses to give clear explanations on his movies(with the exceptions of The Elephant Man and The Straight Story)and he prefers the spectator to making the homework of taking out conclusions.I like a lot the films he does but I do not try to find in them a clear explanation.I just enjoy the extraordinary talent Lynch has of creating emotions and producing feelings without a too coherent story.He uses all the instruments to give us something unique which we may not understand it immediately but something which we will never forget.Inland Empire is a very interesting experiment and we can see the same surrealistic style he used on most of his movies.After Eraserhead,his brilliant first film,Lynch continued with more normal films,like The Elephant Man or Dune.But,with Blue Velvet,he backed to show the oneiric feeling he had shown in Eraserhead (although on a lesser degree).With Inland Empire,I had the perfect sensation I was in a dream(or,best said,on a nightmare).But this film is not for everyone:its running time is of 3 hours.Lynch plays with our perception in the time and the reality to create a very interesting experience but which will not satisfy to the people who are looking for a clear story.Lynch makes us taking out conclusions all the time.The film is made with a digital video and that thing helps because it creates more mystery.Laura Dern brings an amazing performance.She always acted well but I never thought she had so much talent.I do not know if I can recommend Inland Empire to everyone:I liked it pretty much and I think it's a very interesting experiment.But I understand some people will not like it.Inland Empire is very interesting and it makes us taking out conclusions.And I always appreciate that.",Plot,,
"SPOILERS<br /><br />Well, I am back to commenting on silent films. After the atrocity known as the Old Maid Having Her Picture Taken I am happily treated to an experimental English film. After I saw this I imagined how the audience back in 1900 were like after they saw this. They must have been freaking out. Then the Great Train Robbery traumatized the audience more. Okay, back to the film. I guess you could call this suspense of 1900, as a stage coach hits the camera. This was a great silent film, and different. <br /><br />Here is the ""plot"" of How It Feels Like To Be Run Over. This is not really how it feels like to be run over, but still. A stage coach slowly appears on screen. It then is very clear on screen. Then it leaves as quickly as it came. Then another stage coach appears on screen. It becomes clear, but then it changes directions and goes towards the camera. The people in it flail their arms wildly, but it is too late. The stage coach hits the camera. The camera goes blank. Then unreadable words appear on screen quickly.<br /><br />Overall, this is an interesting little silent experimental short. It may be a bit disturbing for audiences back in 1900, but this is not 1900 any more. This also created the infamous thing-hits-camera-and-camera-goes-blank. Well, not really, but this is the first movie ever to do that. The acting was good. You may not be able to see that, but it takes talent to wave your arms. Anyway, this is a surreal silent film that does not really teach you how it is like to get run over.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Recommended Films: Roundhay Garden Scene, Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge, and the Great Train Robbery.",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"""The Well"" is a terrific little movie, and a bold one for 1951. It takes one of the very earliest looks at racism and how it can ... and did in real life in the next decade ... tear apart a community and ultimately a nation. Obviously made on a shoestring budget by mostly unknowns. Some of those involved in the making of this film, I believe, later were blacklisted in Hollywood during the Red-baiting McCarthy era that soon followed. The suspense is relentless and some scenes are heartbreaking. An obscure, near-masterpiece. It deserves to be seen on any level and judged, for the most part, by the standards of its day. Using that yardstick, perhaps it actually deserves a 10. Unfortunately, I doubt many people have seen or heard of this film. HEY, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A COPY OF THIS MOVIE!",Others,,

Watching Terry Kiser crack horribly lame one liners while murdering a comatose teenage boy is like viewing a Carol Burnett skit from hell. This film is fascinating in the same way a major automobile accident is.

It had the mood and mindset of the old fifties movies except alot more gorier. The killer in this keeps a scarf over his face like ""The Shadow"" and he sounds ridiculous but it's always so comical yet tense. The plot and movie are so goofy, and it never takes itself seriously.

"I have a pet peeve and before I begin I want to say a few words about it. I have done a huge number of reviews and am constantly noticing that even the most mediocre films get scores of 10 from some reviewers. While this is definitely a better than average film, no sane person could say it deserves a score akin to that of GONE WITH THE WIND or THE GODFATHER. I think it's great to love a film, but over-scoring it doesn't lend much credence to your review. Just my two cents worth and I'm sure I'll catch heck for saying it.<br /><br />As for this movie, it's a nice little family film that benefits from being very unique and having several wonderful performances. In this slice of pioneer life film, William Holden and his son are left alone after the death of his wife. Needing a mother for the boy and someone to help out around their frontier homestead, he travels to the nearby fort to find a wife. There, he buys an indentured servant (Loretta Young) and brings her back home after marrying her. Not exactly a romance, I know! Unfortunately, there never really is any romance, as Holden and son treat her more like a hired hand and after a while it's obvious she resents this--especially after she works herself to the bone caring for them. Into this very unhappy situation comes ""the stranger"" (Robert Mitchum)--who immediately realizes the problem and proposes to take Rachel away from this drudgery--and pay Holden for her! While there is a lot more to the film, this certainly made for an unusual flick.<br /><br />The performances all around are excellent and the film ended on a very good and not especially sappy note. Well worth your time and I have no serious complaints--other than the writer who indicated that Miss Young was playing a lady who was 25 (yeah, right!!). In actuality she was a decade older and she wasn't fooling anyone--but still a lovely woman regardless of the age difference.",Performance,Plot,

However I do agree that the movie leaves a lot to be desired. This is not a great piece of work - but in a strange way - it is appropriately fragmented. This was a complex band, filmed no doubt at a cross-road. The absence of their (recently deceased) manager, the presence of strangers in the studio, the prospect of ever present angst, and combative postures.<br /><br />While not an easy film to watch, in my opinion a true Beatles fan will take from it the best sense of why this marriage had to end.",Others,,

"Despite of its reputation and the repulsive sounding title, Abel Ferrara's The Driller Killer is more of a social drama about life in the big city than it is a horror shocker. Ferrara himself stars as Reno, an unbalanced painter slowly going crazy due to financial troubles, the noisy punk-band next door, demanding employers and housemates, and non-stop images of the pauperized city. He buys a tool and unleashes his fury on the numerous homeless in the area. Driller Killer is truly grim and as much shocking as the classic film it's clearly inspired on (namely: Taxi Driver) but it lacks a fitting tone and a appropriate background drawing. The film opens with a very confusing sequence in which the protagonist is standing at an altar while being approached by an elderly man. This footage is extra since the 1999 re-release and it looks like Ferrara wanted to supply his film with some kind of spiritual depth. It leads nowhere, though. In fact, take out the killings and you're left with a somewhat boring urban portrait. Driller Killer was included in the infamous list of 'video-nasties' and therefore automatically received a controversial cult-status without people even seeing it. Although the substance matter doesn't belong amongst the other titles in the list, The Driller Killer often wanders on the thin border between trash-exploitation and art-house cinema, as it features voyeuristic elements (a gratuitous lesbian shower sequence) as well as sheer close-ups of blood-puddles and whirring drills. <br /><br />Abel Ferrara without a doubt is one of the most remarkable directors in American cinema history. I'm a huge fan of most of his films like 'The Addiction', 'Bad Lieutenant' and 'The Funeral'It's not that I didn't like 'the Driller Killer', I just think that the poor production values really show off and that Ferrara did not yet had the professionalism and talent to make up for it by adding the trademarks that made his later films so brilliant. If you're interested by the repertoire of this often discussed director, you better don't start by watching Driller Killer. You're appreciate it a lot more after seeing some of his 90's films.",Directional Techniques,Plot,

True it did not contain any of the usual elements of gore & horror that we've seen before but how can that be an endorsement for boredom. Waiting for some character development to resume between the student & the girl but it never did. About the only thing I liked was the portrayal of Dr Vic by the Jack Nicholson lookalike actor.

"Back in the '30s, the studios made dozens of movies that were set in Europe to give Americans during the Depression a sense of fantasy and other world glamor, and to keep their foreign market. ""The Emperor's Candlesticks"" starring William Powell and Luise Rainer is such a film, with supporting roles featuring two young stars, Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. Powell and Rainer are opposing foreign agents who each hide their documents in a pair of candlesticks to be brought to Russia as a gift to a noblewoman. The candlesticks were to be delivered by Powell, but Rainer talks the Austrian who has given him the task to let her do it. They are stolen by her maid and her boyfriend, and both Powell and Rainer try to be the first to recover them.<br /><br />Powell and Rainer are delightful in this crazy story.

Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan portray a prince and his kidnapper's accomplice, respectively, who meet at a masquerade ball, he dressed as Romeo and she as Juliet. Their last scene together is very sweet.<br /><br />This movie is odd for one reason. The stars all lived for a very long time, and in fact, Rainer at this writing is still alive at the age of 96.

Perhaps even unrealistic as I have never heard an old person talk like that.<br /><br />2. The hummingbird showing up at sea was stupid. Then it showed up again in the hurricane at the very end of the movie which was completely ridiculous.<br /><br />3. When Benjamin was born he was born with the mind of a child, the body of an 80-year old but he was baby-sized. The fact that he had the body of a child but was baby-sized was a bit bit inconsistent but fine, I'll accept it. When he aged, his body size grew, but everything other than his body size became younger, and his brain grew older. Then, by the end of the movie, he had the mind of an 80-year old, and the body of a baby, but he was baby-sized again. He should have started as a normal sized 80-year old or he should have died as a large baby. I prefer the former. He could have been born as a 100 lb old man, and that could have explained why the mother died, because she had given birth to a 100 lb old man (she could have been a 300 lb pregnant woman, not any harder to believe than Benjamin's condition itself).

"If the sound of that sonorous, ball-rattling growl wasn't enough to make you wet yourself, you needed to check your pulse to see if it was still there. Or as the poster and the previews so aptly put it: ""If THIS doesn't scare you, YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!""<br /><br />At the time that movies like THE EXORCIST, HALLOWEEN and THE FURY had already bolted from the gate in the Kentucky Derby of scaring up ""boo"" and ""bling"" at the Box Office, there were some nifty little gems that wormed their way between the cracks to scoop up some crumbs and some die-hard fans who became fiercely loyal to them and the franchises they eventually spawned. Of those films that surfaced at the time, the most imaginative and out- and-out frightening of them all was PHANTASM.<br /><br />Mike (A. Michael Baldwin), the youngest brother of Jody (Bill Thornbury) is always underfoot, always shadowing his big brother. Younger bros have a way of doing that to begin with, but Mike has some ""abandonment issues"" and it's not a surprise: their parents were both killed in a car accident, and Jody is not only Mike's legal guardian, but he's all the family the kid has. Well, not counting Jody's best bud Reggie (Reggie Bannister), a ponytailed, laid-back Sixties holdover who drives an ice-cream truck for a living.<br /><br />PHANTASM begins with the mysterious death of a mutual friend of Jody and Reggie's. Forbidden to attend the funeral, Mike sneaks off to Morningside Cemetery anyway to watch the service through binoculars. But the event that kicks this scarefest into high gear is not the funeral, but what happens AFTERWARDS.<br /><br />The moment the mourners are gone, a hearse arrives and a seven-foot tall, gaunt vision of terror dressed in the usual funeral director's outfit, picks up the casket WITH HIS BARE HANDS and dumps it into the back of the hearse like a grocery sack. <br /><br />Mike has just had his first encounter with the ghoul known only as The Tall Man, but it definitely won't be the last. <br /><br />He manages to get brother Jody and their friend Reggie roped into believing what he's seen, and trying to find out what The Tall Man is up to, and then how to stop him. The rest of the movie is catapulted into a world where dream states and reality exist almost as one, and you have no idea from moment to terrifying moment what the hell is going to happen next. <br /><br />Using every trick in the book that could be created before the benefits of CGI, director Don Coscarelli blends horror, sci-fi, comedy, fantasy and everything in between to keep the audience laughing and screaming, sometimes all at once. Referencing Mike Oldfield's haunting theme to THE EXORCIST, composers Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave came up with a superb score that's just as haunting and memorable in its own right, underscoring the visuals perfectly. <br /><br />And if the acting is not top drawer from a then no-name cast, at least the performances are somewhat natural and not over-acted. The key scene-stealer is Bannister, a great instinctive Cheech-and-Chong-type comic, whose priceless expressions and timing would be enlisted for a whole slew of PHANTASM sequels.<br /><br />But the acting awards overall have to go to Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man. A former schoolteacher, Scrimm, with very little help from the makeup department, cut such a formidable figure of fright, that it would be impossible to imagine any sequels without him. (Indeed; he's in all of them.) <br /><br />And the spare special effects budget is used wisely on briefly glimpsed but highly effective set-pieces based on gore and intense action, especially the mainstay of the PHANTASM series: the ominous and terrifying Silver Spheres. <br /><br />If (Gawd forbid!) any talk of a remake actually leads to an upcoming movie, (and there HAS been talk), I would only hope that Don Coscarelli is hired to do it justice. No other director could bring to it the sparks of originality that spawned the series in the first place.<br /><br />A little on the dated side, but for anyone who considers themselves a true fan of the genre, this is REQUIRED viewing!",Directional Techniques,Performance,Music
"I saw THE PYX 20 years ago on TV, in a ""pan & scan"" version, and I thought the film's mood was memorable enough for me to seek it out once it became available in widescreen. I finally saw it in WS and the ""pan & scan"" version suddenly looks better in comparison. So much of the action took place on the far side of the screen (far left or far right) that the screen composition was almost silly. Some scenes, like the one with Christopher Plummer and that gay man walking in Old Montreal, or the interrogation scene we're shot from so far away that I felt I needed binoculars.<br /><br />If the cinematography was frustrating, the music score was nearly disastrous. What sounded good back in 1973 doesn't necessarily sound good today, certainly regarding that overplayed Joan Baez-like song. The music during the Devil worshiping scene is basically sounds/music played backwards. Playing music backwards to hear Satan is now a funny cliché and that music certainly didn't help create any tension. The acting was forced. Karen Black looked remarkably old even though this is one of her earliest films. The makeup job was bad and the above mentioned cinematography made her look older than she really was. Christopher Plummer's role is almost negligible. The mood is still there but it's impact is lost when seeing in WS. In fact, as the film went on, the less I enjoyed the atmosphere. I realized it was over-zealously lugubrious, not atmospheric. It's also very dated but it's not awful because of it. In fact, it's one of its positive aspects.<br /><br />THE PYX is a frustrating films ever. So much good stuff going for it and yet so little of it actually adds up to a satisfying cinematic experience. The best thing about it is the 1970s feel/look of Montreal. It's an amazing time capsule.",Directional Techniques,Music,
"Really enjoyed this film. Well structured and pretty unique telling of a good thought provoking story.<br /><br />We tried to work out what was happening and must admit to failing miserably up until the last ten minutes. In its own way the film was actually pretty pacey and I think it worked better being only some 90 minutes long. It might have dragged a little being any longer. Thought all of the characters were good and added to the overall mood of the film.<br /><br />The story may well be not as original as we thought it was but it kept our interest with all the various twists. It relied upon the plot, script and acting to keep it going and all in all it worked very well.<br /><br />We saw it on a recommendation and would likewise recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />",Plot,Performance,

After books like Ted Fishman's ""China Inc."" or Gordon Chang's ""The Coming Collapse of China"", this film arrives as a breath of fresh air sharing at a very personal level just how a rapidly changing China isn't always dealing with her 'prosperity' and globalization as easily as we would hope. The World is perhaps one of the best modern Asian films in years. We can only hope Zhang Ke Jia will continue to write, direct and interpret his homeland for us for years to come.

"Brad Dourif (Billy in Cukoo's Nest, Hazel in Wise Blood and the voice of Chucky) is hilarious as Fingerless, the other characters are the usual pathetic humanoids struggling with their dreams and weaknesses. The mountain is the obstacle to life's fulfillment, people are dammed to pursue their dreams to their own destruction and only the old woman in the house at the base of the mountain knows what life is all about.

"Forgetting that this film version of From The Earth To The Moon is nowhere near the spirit of the original tale Jules Verne was trying to tell, usually his work requires a big budget and a ton of good special effects. This film got neither.<br /><br />Looking at the credits tonight I noted it was an RKO production released by Warner Brothers. My guess is that the film was finished and in the can when RKO went under and was sold to Warner Brothers to distribute. Also the fact that it was produced by Benedict Bogeaus who was a producer of B films of varying quality tells me why it did not get the budget for decent special effects.<br /><br />Bogeaus was not the guy for this kind of film. Take a look at his list of credits. He did several westerns with John Payne, noir films with George Raft and some of them pretty good. He was out of his element doing science fiction.<br /><br />Verne's original novel had a bit of humor in it. But someone at RKO drained every bit of it. They even added a stowaway love interest in Debra Paget who does not make the trip in the book. She's paired opposite Don Dubbins who is scientist Joseph Cotten's assistant in creating the rocket.<br /><br />So instead of humor we get a lot of high falutin' claptrap coming from the mouths of Joseph Cotten and George Sanders the armaments manufacturer who is jealous of Cotten. Sanders especially looked ill at some of the dialog he was required to speak. He came across as a pouty kid and George knew it.<br /><br />I do wonder if Jack Warner looked at this thing before he bought it for Warner Brothers.",Visual Effect,Directional Techniques,Plot

"""The Last Seduction 2"" is by no means high-quality entertainment. It's one of those movies you catch on cable at around 2 A.M., watch it since there's nothing better on, and end up getting sucked in by it. I mean, the original film was good, but it wasn't like it was a masterpiece. So I don't feel the filmmakers were being blasphemous by making this cheap, direct-to-TV sequel (the original also started out direct-to-TV, but later was released in theaters). Joan Severance is certainly no Linda Fiorentino. She pretty much plays a one-dimensional stereotype of a film noir vixen. But her performance is passable and like Fiorentino, she's not too difficult on the eyes. There are those little flaws that you'd expect in a film of this nature. For example, there's one scene where the female bounty hunter goes to a travel agency, which is in New York, and the man at the desk is obviously a Brit trying badly to hide his accent. But those are the kinds of things you can simply laugh at, and it adds to the fun of the film. I could've done without the scene where the film's villain punches one of his pregnant employees in the face. If this were a film of substance, I would say that the scene was shown to add to the film's realism. But instead, it was just shown for the sake of shock value, as a cheap device to make the audience hate the villain. The plot itself is actually quite good, and it has some nice twists and turns. I found myself hooked in throughout most of the film. As long as you take it with a grain of salt, ""The Last Seduction 2"" is decent late night entertainment.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
"An above-average entry in the series. A stage magician, the ever-loathsome Jack Cassidy, sneaks away in mid-act while supposedly hidden in a locked box and snuffs his partner and blackmailer, Nehemia Persoff. Cassidy's secret is that he was a guard in a concentration camp when he was young and it simply wouldn't do much for his career if his previous identity were to be leaked out. The murder, of course, is all Persoff's fault anyway. As a blackmailer he's unskilled. A good blackmailer, like a good virus or parasite, never demands so much of the host that the host expires. It asks just enough.<br /><br />Anyway, enter Columbo, stage left, in the brand new stylish brown raincoat his wife just bought him. In the course of the film he does everything possible to get rid of it short of throwing it away. He leaves it out in the open to be stolen -- in his car and at police headquarters.<br /><br />Cassidy, ""The Great Santini"", has planned several tiers of deception to give himself an alibi. First he won't reveal where he was at the time of the murder because it is a professional secret. (Illusionists take these things seriously. ""The trick is told when the trick is sold."") Columbo finds out Cassidy's location despite the lack of cooperation, but Cassidy has another level of camouflage prepared. In the end, Columbo penetrates that as well, not so much by a careful assembling of clues and physical evidence but, as is usual, by an intuition so keen as to be almost magical in its own right. I mean, for instance, what the hell makes Columbo suspect the stage magician in the first place? There are roles for Bob Dishy and Robert Loggia too, but they're so minor as to be almost cameos. The most memorable supporting player is Cassidy's daughter Della, played by Cynthia Sikes. Not that she can act, but she looks mouthwateringly delicious in that glittering one-piece outfit she wears onstage as Cassidy's assistant magician. I wonder who's going to take care of her after Cassidy is put away? I'd have volunteered. She might have shown me some tricks.<br /><br />It's an episode I always look forward to watching.

"Loretta Young always managed to bring a certain cool quality to her movies and has come to epitomize the feminine beauty and elegance of the 1930s. It's hard to tell if The Unguarded Hour would've turned out quite as well without an actress of her charm to divert the viewer from the plot holes. The story itself is very entertaining and amusing, once you come to accept their motives and not ask questions such as ""why on earth doesn't she tell everything to her husband and get it over with?"" But of course, a woman of such beauty and elegance (there, I said it again) can't be wrong, can she? And we wouldn't have had a movie to start with.<br /><br />If you manage to get a hold of this rarely seen gem which hasn't been released on DVD as yet, you're quite sure to spend a very enjoyable time, trying to guess the perpetrator of the villainy and feasting your eyes on the rosy cheeks and elegant gowns of the damsel in distress.",Performance,,
"Perhaps imperfect as a neatly tied-up documentary statement, the film raises real contentious questions about ethnic stereotypes, youth, sexuality, and art (kudos for that). But from a purely experiential perspective this is an intense, original, and completely ecstatic trip in both the cultural and aesthetic dimensions. Personally I see nothing compromised or shallow about mixing in a healthy dose of gratuitously beautiful, highly stylized photography for the pure raw aesthetic bliss of it. The film is also quite interesting from an anthropological angle in terms of how the documented phenomenon quickly takes root, consumes these good peoples' identities 24-7, organically grows, divides, mutates, rapidly spans generations and groups, sweeps up even infants who intuitively jack right in to the main line, and seems to strongly channel ancient ancestral rites straight into South Central, where it weaves a crazy web of hope and ecstatic optimism through the beleaguered community like beautiful wildflowers in a cracked asphalt lot.

There is decent acting in the flick, but only by a very young Robert DeNiro. Shelley Winters never was much as an actress. Bruce Dern is pretty decent in his role as well, but he seems to excel in bizarre character roles. There is plenty of totally senseless violence, and these people are depicted as just totally evil.

"This film has some interesting moments, especially at the beginning, but it is entirely too long and disjointed. Lynch likes to make the point again and again that our sense of narrative is socially constructed, and he thus takes great delight in subverting our expectations by breaking the narrative line repeatedly. Okay. Enough already. We get the point. On the other hand, we might argue that a film with a tightly woven narrative line is never a bad thing. What is bad are the tiresome shots of darkened hallways, the constant entering into darkened rooms while the crappy electronic score kicks in (I guess we're supposed to feel a troubling eeriness in the air) in the background, and subtexted stage acts (in this case humans with fake rabbit heads) that don't enrich the story line, even though they are meant to thematize the breakdown in marital relations by showing how the language of married couples ceases to be communicative (gee, didn't T. S. Eliot already do this?). David Lynch, it's time for you to reinvent yourself. Stop dishing out cinematic crap that looks like a remake of your last film. This is a film for die-hard Lynch fans only. To call it enriching and fresh is laughable. If it were tomorrow, then I probably wouldn't have seen this film today. Right? Sheesh.",Performance,Plot,

I think I like this Marlene Dietrich vehicle even better. Oh, this is a charmer, all right. The plot is too complicated to describe here, but the story is very clever and very entertaining. The film is sweet, romantic and quite funny. The cast is exceptional. Bruce Cabot is surprisingly great as the leading man. You might remember him as the block of wood who won out over the monkey in King Kong. He must have gained some talent as he aged; he's much more handsome at this point, and has an effortless charm, reminiscent of Clark Gable. Roland Young plays his rival. One thing I'll always love about Golden Age Hollywood is the bevy of character actors, something we have entirely lost in the present.

"Hypothetical question time, peeps. Let's say you're a budding collegiate journalist, and you are looking for the scoop of the century. Something way outside the box. Something that doesn't involve covering rush week parties, local charity bake sales, sports events and the usual bland 'human interest' stories. <br /><br />Let's kick it up a notch, even. Fred Krueger. Michael Myers. Jason Voorhees. Charles Lee Ray, aka ""Chucky."" What would it be worth to you to be able to interview these guys BEFORE they started their careers in stalking, terror and mass murder, and then have the rare opportunity to be able to follow them, step-by-step, as they outlined every trick of the trade, every detail of how they create their 'legend' at the very beginning?<br /><br />You will finally find your answers in Scott Glosserman's blackly funny docu-satire BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON. There have been very similar movies made in this vein, such as MAN BITES DOG and in some respects THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but the best and most effective examples of this sub-genre have always come from overseas. BEHIND THE MASK is the first independently-made American feature that finally gets it right. <br /><br />Nathan Baesel is a name you should be watching for in the future, because in his film debut as the titular 'hero' of the piece, he's funny, charming, self-ingratiating and as focused, dedicated and meticulous as any up-and-coming, hard-charging young hopeful should be. Too bad his biggest dream in life is to become the heir apparent to Mikey, Freddy and Jason. He's like Jim Carrey with a sharp implement fetish...only scarier! <br /><br />Angela Goethals is also very good as Taylor Gentry, the aspiring on-camera reporter who gets sucked into Leslie's disarming charm when he agrees to allow her and her film crew to document every aspect of his first major endeavor: the selection, preparation for and actual execution of a bunch of drunk, horny teens. At one point, the crew even get roped into becoming co-conspirators of sorts. <br /><br />Taylor and her team are even introduced to Les' doting mentor, Eugene (a great turn by Scott Wilson) and his lovely wife. It's all a good time until somebody gets a post-hole digger shoved through their chest...<br /><br />There are really so many things I want to blab about concerning this great deconstruction of the slasher horror genre, one of the best since the first SCREAM installment. But the delights go over better if you know nothing about what's coming, so as far as saying anything else, I love the fact that horror icons Robert Englund, Zelda Rubenstein and Kane Hodder all lend their considerable presences to the film. (I won't say where you'll see them...just pay close attention.)<br /><br />And I also want to mention the best part of the flick - when it makes its startling transition from ""faux horror documentary"" to out-and-out horror film. Don't worry; you'll pretty much know when it happens. <br /><br />Glosserman and co-writer David J. Stieve have done a great job in finding an imaginative way to recharge the batteries of the slasher flick on a low-budget, using clichés in a manner that nobody has ever thought of, rather than simply giving in to the temptation to simply use them like every other 'FRIDAY THE 13TH'/NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET/HALLOWEEN knockoff.Gorehounds will find the relatively light blood-letting a little disappointing, but there's so much more to enjoy here than the raptures of evisceration and dismemberment.<br /><br />I'm excited that this is Glosserman's first feature, because it makes a great calling card, and gives us fans so much more to look forward to from him. <br /><br />So if you are a fan who's become a little jaded with the horror releases of late, go rent BEHIND THE MASK immediately!.

I like its buildings, its landscapes, its history, its people and its culture. So when being able to see an Italian movie, or should I call it a mini-series, that deals with all these aspects of Italian life, I knew I had to watch it.<br /><br />I could keep this review very short really, because all I want to say is: watch it for yourself! I'll do my best to describe it, but in my opinion there isn't a better way to understand how good this actually is, as by sitting through the more than 6 hours and enjoying every minute of it. From the fifties on until today, we follow everything that happens in Italy: communism, anarchy, the Maffia, natural disasters, an economic boom, but also banal things like for instance soccer (in fact everything that has any importance in the history of Italy and the minds of the Italians) is shown in this movie. You'll see everything evolve through the decades and follow it all through the eyes of the Carati's, a family that isn't spared of any fortune or bad luck...<br /><br />This movie may seem incredibly long to most of you and I'm sure that many people will never watch it, just because of the length. But those people are really wrong. If you take the time to watch it, than you'll not only get to see something of Italy's history, but you'll also get to know the cities, the landscapes, the people. Everything that makes Italy what it is today.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because I'm so interested in Italy and everything that ever happened there, perhaps it is because I'm a great admirer of the European cinema.

If you were like me and thought ""Even if it is cheesy, it might turn out to be fun"", then I'm giving you a Get Out Of Jail Free card with this review. It is not enough that we must be subjected to one-dimensional characters, painfully predictable dialogue, hackneyed plot lines, cliché villains, headache-inducing camera work, and one of the worst climaxes ever recorded. No. Not by a long shot. The atrocity here runs deeper. Our intelligence is insulted, our tastes are ridiculed, and our freedom of choice turns on us and squeezes its fist around our throats. This film registers as a negative, a black hole, in the canon of cinematic creations. There were parts where I imagined the producers saying, ""Just leave it that way. They'll never notice"" or ""You don't have to explain that, it'll fly right over their heads."" I understand that the budget for this film was (gasp) a measly 20 million dollars, but lack of financial resources is NEVER, EVER an excuse to feed gold-plated crap to the masses. Christopher Eccleston fans may get a slight quiver of a laugh out of his (failed) quirky turn as The Rider, the wraith-like shape shifting ambassador of ""The Dark"". But in all seriousness, I think he may have just needed a few extra bucks for a down payment on an Aston Martin he might have had his eye on. Otherwise the acting is not even a subject to be brought up, since cardboard cutouts don't require much effort to portray. The special effects are where all the money went, and they're fairly decent. Though I refuse to count this as praise, any more than I would appreciate a smattering of whipped cream on the top of a rancid pile of stinking, eight-week old peach cobbler.<br /><br />In any fantasy, there are rules that must be set and limitations where magic is to be found. Otherwise, the whole thing becomes a free-for-all that never holds any kind of credibility. I don't think I have the time or the energy to describe all of the problems, violations, and inconsistencies I saw occur within this film that barely topped two hours. It would be a real challenge for someone to sit down and try to catch them all. There was no respect for the genre here, just a seemingly voracious need to exploit the current fantasy craze. If after The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, and Harry Potter, the bigwigs in the studios think that this sort of thing can pass as acceptable, then the legacy of Story is over already. Yes, I am being overly dramatic, but at this point, it's too late to turn back. Time once lost is not recoverable, money once spent requires more labor to regain, and the wish to walk away from a story feeling like we've been entertained, had our minds and hearts opened, once dashed is hard pressed to be soothed back again from boundless feelings of deep discontent and a sense that we have been robbed.

It is very Californiaish, particularly in some outdoors shots which are definitely not New York countryside.

Ironically the house he is killed in is sold to the kids of one the guys that kills him. He regenerates from having a dog kill people and eat crap and then goes to get revenge on his killers. so far so good, it sounds as a crap horror movie should be.<br /><br />But having Mr Snoop Dogg playing a pimp in the 70's (in flashback scenes) and a murdering pimp in the 90's is so ridiculously cool it hurts. Even though the whole movie doesn't make ANY sense at any point, it's just cool to see Mr Dogg in a pimp outfit. Also the pun of having two token white kids getting killed in the first minute, the cheesy red colour of the blood, the totally unfitting comic relief of 2 talking heads and all skanky girls in the movie being played by white chicks makes this an absolutely excellent movie! I admit, i have a taste for bad movies. Horrible sci-fi and 80's action movies are a must-see in my opinion, it's cheap laughs! this movie is fitting for that so amazingly i'm getting the DVD tomorrow and organizing a 'movie nite' next week to show this (together with 'Alien Sex Party') to some friends. Hilarity guaranteed! So, get a case of beer, some illegal, mind altering substances and a few good buddies that can appreciate bad movies and have a blast with this Snoop Dogg gem! Oh, and the probably totally unmeant Fatboy Slim homage was the cherry on the cake. A DJ kid wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat (as does Mr Slim in the 'Rockafeller Skank' video) asks another DJ 'can you do a solo performance, i need some time off right about now, funk soul brother'. Comedy gold, right there.",Plot,,
"This film makes my soul cry. My friends and I were on a kick where we would rent random movies and either fall in love with them or sit there and make fun of them. A Crack in the Floor definitely fell into the second category. The ""characters"" are really nothing more than muddled stereotypes with nothing motivating them. The bad guy gets sodomized as a young boy, so he decides to kill everyone he can. The kids know people are dying, so the split up to go screw around in the dark woods. Not exactly convincing. Some of the movies ""highlights"": When the perverted redneck tells the little boy he's ""pretty like his mamma"". When the kids are talking about pot on the car ride. When Busey shows up and a girl freaks out about someone KILLING CHICKENS!. When at the end one of my friends said, ""they're all gonna die, there's no other way for this movie to end and make sense"" Yep, there was no ending that could have proven any less crappy.",Plot,,
"I've seen this movie at a festival and i just hate it. I've seen lots of movies in black-white, or documentary etc. but none of them was as boring as this movie. It was not a movie actually, it was just a crazy woman talking about how much she hates the God and how to make pasta by using craps... It was like, a torture, misery. I was like ""please just stop"" but the movie was not just so boring but also so long. There are lots of scenes that has nothing to say... There is no point... Once i was at a ""movie workshop"" and there was a guy teaching writing a scenario and he told us that ""a movie is about the visions, it's about what you show people and what they see. If someone talks talks talks about life etc. it's not a movie. It's a video that you shot, but not a movie."" I wish, someone has told this to the director of this movie... I hate it!!!",Plot,Directional Techniques,

"The most eagerly awaited Flynn movie has at last made it to DVD! Unavailable for some years except on a VHS tape and an obscure over priced Korean disc it, thankfully, is back in the Warner Bros. stable where it belongs. The wait was worth it for the disc is simply pluperfect! With rich vibrant three-strip Technicolor and sharply defined images it is a joy to behold! Flynn is terrific in the title role of the great lover and roue. Not withstanding perhaps a nod to the actor's own lifestyle the part was nevertheless Taylor made for him. And although it was said at the time that he was slowing down and that he hit the booze while filming there is no evidence of it on screen. The great swashbuckler cuts a fine figure in his many fabulous costume changes throughout the picture. These costumes - designed by the great Travilla - won the 1948 Acadamy Award for best costume design.<br /><br />The supporting cast were well chosen too! Robert Douglas is great as Flynn's adversary - the evil Duke DeLorca. His dark eyes blackened even more to make him look that bit extra villainous. Alan Hale is once again Flynn's faithful sidekick but after 12 movies this was to be their final picture together. He died the following year. The female lead is taken by the beautiful Swedish actress Vivica Lindfors. Here she plays Margaret Queen of Spain and the one true love of Juan. Lindfors' final film was ""Stargate"" in 1994! She died in 1995 at the age of 75.<br /><br />""The Adventures of Don Juan"" is well directed by Vincent Sherman and is probably his best remembered movie. The atmosphere, the colour and the sets in the court scenes are really very impressive. But now and then the film gets a little bogged down with some palace intrigue until the picture's famous set piece - the brilliantly staged sword-fight on the magnificent palace staircase. It ranks as one of the cinema's finest duels and Flynn will always be remembered for it even though that amazing leap with the knife was performed by stuntman and B picture actor Jock Mahoney.<br /><br />Then, of course there is the music by Max Steiner - one of his very best scores! Particularly splendid is his music for Juan's Parade into London with its masterful use of bells and chimes. Also the wistful Ballade which accompanies Juan on his many and various balcony climbings, the driving action music for the fight in the palace and the gorgeous love theme for the scenes with Juan and the Queen especially for the sequence near the end. Here the theme is heard in full bloom as the lovers say farewell to each other forever (""I shall be the only one who knew, for just a little while, that there was no Queen""). Interestingly Flynn's usual swashbuckling composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold - who had served him brilliantly on past successes such as ""Captain Blood"", ""The Adventures Of Robin Hood"" and ""The Sea Hawk"" -was originally slated to score ""The Adventures Of Don Juan"" as far back as 1945, but by the time the picture went into production the esteemed composer had left Hollywood and returned to his birthplace Vienna. As brilliant a composer as Korngold was it's difficult to imagine he would have topped Steiner's exceptional score. But alas we will never know!<br /><br />So quite a wonderful disc all round with good extras consisting of a commentary by director the late Vincent Sherman and Flynn authority Rudy Behlmer, a trailer and some instantly forgettable old fashioned shorts but the movie is all, so enjoy.

"This animated movie from Dreamworks is visually stunning and at the same time hilarious. The graphics of the movie are really top notch and path breaking. The imagination of the bee life is really cool. Imagine a bee having bath, applying some hair gel, deodorant and eating breakfast all of which is nothing but honey.<br /><br />The movie is about a bee (Barry) who has just graduated! Yes graduated and will now be doing some work at the honey comb. But he just can't decide what work to do. So he ventures out of the honey comb and make friends with a human. One day he finds out that humans like honey and they trap a lot of bee to make it. Now he decides to sue the human race for illegally taking the honey made by bees. This single point could be the most hilarious point in the history of movies. Surely no prizes for guessing who wins the case, it's a ""BEE MOVIE"".<br /><br />One should give a pat on the back to the writers and the screen players of the movies for writing such a hilarious movie and a beautiful movie. Even the quality of the animation is great. Don't forget to watch the fun with the Dreamworks logo at the start of the movie.<br /><br />http://moviesopinion.blogspot.com/",Visual Effect,Plot,
"Although it fails as a film in multiple ways (e.g. boredom, repetitions, predictability, ..) I think it is a total failure because it is a political agitprop piece and not an actual movie.<br /><br />A fascist-catholic law&order government somewhere along the lines of Franquist Spain which eliminated all Muslims, the Labor Party and homosexuals runs Britain in 2020. Yea, right, ..., that's what is to fear judging from the last decades of British politics. Cameron is Hitler and Bush' war made it possible.<br /><br />I expected a deep study on contemporary authoritarian tendencies (which hold a grip on all(!) parties all across the political spectrum) but was treated to a partisan Liberal agitprop vehicle. Thanks a lot, I'd like to make my own conclusions. It's not like it was the Labour party which holds the reigns since 1997 which has enacted all current anti-Terror laws and has greatly enhanced the power of the state and reduced privacy and freedom of the individual.<br /><br />Iraq anyone? Nah, people, fear a Catholic-Conservative dictator ...<br /><br />I'd like my movies thought-provoking and free of at least blunt in your face partisanship. V for Vendetta is lousy.",Others,,
"""Taxidermia"" is one of the biggest surprises I've had with recent films. It has a blend of disgusting and shocking acts rendered poetic with absolutely beautiful camera-work and style. Even at its grossest, one isn't nearly as repulsed as they should be. And trust me, there's a lot of deviant behavior (including bestiality, masturbation, feederism, and vomit) on display here. Its all credit to director György Pálfi, who has crafted one of the most original visions in recent cinema. Its far from a perfect film, but its sheer audacity is refreshing compared to the safe and sterile cinema coming from all over the world today. Its a throw back to the 70s, when filmmakers had the guts to load the screen with offensive and politically incorrect imagery to force the viewer to think.<br /><br />Don't mistake this as being merely a shock value fest. There's a good amount of subtext and depth to the film in a manner similar to Takashi Miike's finest work. The acting is very good, and the performers manage to make their deviant characters oddly human and sympathetic despite the increasingly surreal nature of the film. The film is flawed (the middle section in particular lags pretty badly), but I'd rather watch an interesting if imperfect film any day than successful tripe. ""Taxidermia"" is a film I feel will become a cult classic in the years to come. Not for all tastes, but those interested will love it. (8/10)",Performance,,
"A previous reviewer compared The Fantastic Journey to shows like Stargate SG-1 and Sliders. He listed 8 similarities between the shows. He should have listed a 9th. Which show, you ask? What about Lost? You have a doctor, (Fred in TFJ, Jack in Lost), a psychic, (Liana in TFJ, Desmond in Lost,) a man of faith, (Varian in TFJ, and Locke, in Lost,) see the similarities? If you don't, I do. In TFJ, you have a scientific expedition lost in the Bermuda Triangle. In Lost, you have 48 survivors from a plane crash on an island somewhere in the South Pacific. In TFJ, our little group of travelers is trying to get back to their times. In Lost, that's not so clear. Jack wants to go home in the first three seasons. Locke doesn't. When you consider the similarities between the two shows, you can't help but recognize the fact that this '70s show was an influence on Lost. J.J. Abrams and Co., say that the game Myst, was one of the influences. Did I leave someone out? I did? Well, my bad. You also have another man of science, in Jonathan Willaway. Did I leave anyone else out? I don't think so. If I did, too late to change it now.",Plot,,
"A couple of months ago my friends were talking about the new Finnish fantasy film Kohtalon Kirja. I have to say that I did not expect much from the movie, but I also didn't expect anything this bad.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing good to say about the film. The acting is terrible. Even the famous Finnish veteran actors sounded like amateurs. Visual look of the film is beyond description and the soundtrack had some worst heavy metal music I have ever heard.<br /><br />But the real reason I hate the film so much is the action. It was obvious that many of the actors had no training in any martial art. Even the most basic training would have made a big difference. All the moves in the fight scenes were slow and painfully clumsy.<br /><br />This film isn't even funny as a bad trash movie. It is just bad. Avoid it like a plaque.",Performance,Music,Visual Effect

"This film, directed by Eric Styles, has the distinction that it has reversed the emphasis from a woman, to a man, for being the object of sexual desire. Otherwise, it doesn't make much sense. The best redeeming factor is some of the great views of Paris.<br /><br />Sarah, as played by Melanie Griffith, is annoying. That little girl voice in a grown up woman is a turn off. This is a mature woman that has taken up with a much younger, and attractive young man who is seen naked, and or, in different stages of it, in the film. Sarah makes a grave mistake in taking the train back to Paris and holding the precious coin in her hand while she falls asleep! Hellooo! She could have hidden in some other part of her body!<br /><br />Jack, the young man about town, is attracted to the newly arrived American ingenue, Jenny. They immediately fall in love and are seen having sex without any protection. Sorry, but has anyone heard of AIDS? Jenny is made to look terribly provincial with that horrible permanent and her even uglier pigtails.<br /><br />The film doesn't go anywhere, as we figured what was going to be the outcome early on. The direction doesn't help matters at all. Other than a vacation in Paris, what is Malcom McDowell doing in this movie? He only appears in one scene and is seen in another! This film could have been cast with lesser known actors and probably would have been better than what one sees on the screen.<br /><br />Better luck to Mr. Styles next time out.",Directional Techniques,Plot,
"I have to admit that after reading the users comments from ""adyt23"" and another terrible review, I went into it without any great expectations and with my finger on the erase button as it was recorded on my PVR(Tivo in the U S). But boy am I glad I didn't erase it and ended up watching the movie!! I don't post many reviews on IMDb as I only post them when I'm am very pleasantly surprised by a movie as I was with this one. I really don't know how anybody could call this a bad movie. I thought it was one of the more memorable movies I've seen in the past few months or so and I highly recommend it. Their were some familiar faces so it was not just a bunch of unknowns in a low budget flick, it may not have had a big budget, but what it did with the finances it did have was put together a really good somewhat suspenseful type drama that involves bookies, gambling, a bit of drugs and all the ingredients that makes these ""under the radar"" or lesser known types of movies worth watching. The story is about a man played by Etan Embry, who has a serious gambling addiction and the ordeals he goes through to try and make good on his marriage. The events leading up to the final scene in the movie are riveting and I couldn't stop watching as it kept me glued to my seat the entire time.

"The start of this movie gave me hope I was on to something OK. There was some artistry in it, and the opening twist was promising. (But why does the bloody graffiti, i.e. ""Come and see,"" have to be written in such phony, perfect handwriting?) That was all lost in an instant when Ziyi Zhang's character suddenly revealed herself for ""what she was"" - in the process suddenly going from normal middle class immigrant girl to ludicrous, evil, wry, hissing, (awkwardly) seductive, bloken engrish Oriental villainess.

"A Quiet Place to Kill is not be confused with the earlier Orgasmo, though unfortunately confusing the pair is very easy as they're from the same director, both feature American actress Carroll Baker and they were both released under the title 'Paranoia'! Quite what the reason for both films featuring the same title is anyone's guess: I know that Italian filmmakers were more interested in making money than anything else, but surely releasing two films under the same title would do more harm than good when it came to the box office...but oh well. It's usually Orgasmo that gets most of the fans; but if you ask me, this second version of Paranoia is the better of the two. Like Lenzi's earlier 'So Sweet, So Perverse', it would appear that the plot has been lifted from the French classic 'Les Diaboliques', and focuses on a love triangle. Playboy Maurice is married to Constance, a woman who decides to invite Maurice's ex-wife Helen to stay with them. Helen doesn't question it too much and accepts the invitation, and soon learns that the reason she's there is to help Constance kill Maurice.<br /><br />The first half of the film is much better than the second, as A Quiet Place to Kill unfortunately looses a bit of steam once it gets the first part of the plot out of the way. In spite of that, however, the film is certainly a very interesting Giallo and definitely delivered many of the things I love about this type of film. Umberto Lenzi manages to ensure that all of the major players are interesting, and Lenzi also ensures that all are guilty in one way or another, which ensures that everyone deserves what they get by the time it finishes. Carroll Baker is not my favourite Giallo heroine, but I liked her in this one. She seems to enjoy acting alongside Jean Sorel, who is as charming as ever. Unknown actresses Anna Proclemer and Marina Coffa round off the cast, along with the experienced Alberto Dalbés - all of which fit into their roles well. The upper class setting does the film a lot of favours, and the locations and fashions are all nice to look at. The plot mostly flows well and while it's usually fairly clear where it's going, A Quiet Place to Kill still manages to be interesting. This is not the best Giallo that Lenzi made (that would be Seven Blood-Stained Orchids), but it's certainly a good one and I recommend it.",Performance,Plot,

"I admit it: I didn't watch this show when it first aired. I was an 80's kid, so I was far more concerned with shows like Ducktails and Tailspin than any dumb show about a P.I.<br /><br />But, luckily, reruns have managed to re-introduce me to the world of the 80's shows. I've since become rather obsessed with my ""three 80's M's"" -- Matlock, M*A*S*H and Magnum.<br /><br />All I can say is, this ain't no Macguyver. Tom Magnum is NOT a PC guy left-wing activist who makes speeches at the end of the episode on the environment, or who can build a nuclear reactor from a piece of gum and a shoestring. Magnum is, as his name suggests, the kind of guy who shoots first and asks questions later. He always manages to get himself in trouble, and sort of mooches off his friends. He doesn't always know who is the bad guy, and he has been known to kill a few people in cold blood. He doesn't always say or do the right thing. He has some serious baggage, from his wife and daughter being killed (or were they??) and Vietnam. Some times-- well, quite often, he screwed up. His closest friends are usually in danger-- or killed-- because of him.<br /><br />This makes it sound bad, I know, but you know, these are the things I love about Magnum. He's got baggage, he's not all together, he's a bit messed up. Not seriously psychotic, you understand, but not all together. I love Magnum: the play between him and Higgins is just delightful, and his poor mooched off friends just can't say no to him, hard as they try. And, you know he's like that, but you love him anyway. Silly loud Hawaiian shirts and all. You can almost always count on at least one bar fight or car chase, He's sort of a gun-slinger of the 1980's America.<br /><br />Magnum is first and foremost, Fun. Tom Selleck and cast are utterly delightful, and I think this show is quite underrated, because when you take away the car chases there are still first and foremost good story lines and good writing.<br /><br />They have serious episodes, and they have silly ones. I tended not to like the sillier episodes: those episodes usually ranked as the best in the series stand up very well. They had good episodes and better episodes, I can only think of one or two eps in the entire series I just didn't like, but they aren't horrible, just not my taste. If you get a chance to see Did You See the SunRise parts 1 and 2, Infinity and Jelly Doughnuts (I don't know if that's the real title) or any of them, really, you watch about 3 of them and you'll be hooked. Especially Infinity and Jelly Doughnuts, I think it's one of the best episodes ever. And the series finale was brilliant, really most of them were just fun but they had some utterly brilliant episodes. You really feel like you know Magnum, and I think it's because he's just a little messed up that makes him feel real to you. That and he talks to you: often he says things like, ""I know what you're thinking, and you're right, I shouldn't have..."" or ""I know what you're thinking, but this time, you're wrong. Higgins is the one who..."" I really wish I'd gotten into this series when it was on, and that I appreciated it for what it was, but alas, I did not.

"Another trip to the altar for Bulldog Drummond is averted when at a pre-wedding gathering in Switzerland a Swiss detective is murdered and an artificial diamond, courtesy of its inventor Halliwell Hobbes to bride and groom John Howard and Louise Campbell. That sets off a round of a little over an hour of fast paced adventure as Drummond once again shows up Scotland Yard.<br /><br />Bulldog Drummond's Peril steps into the realm of science fiction with Halliwell Hobbes inventing a machine that can create diamonds, a process we know takes millions of years of geologic pressure. The gizmo he has looks like it was made from spare parts in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.<br /><br />The film is blessed with two villains, industrialist Matthew Boulton and rival scientist Porter Hall both of whom want to get their hands on that formula and profit off it in some way. One way that wasn't even considered was that very few diamonds are used as jewelry. The majority are industrial strength and used for things like oil drill bits. A way to manufacture those babies on the cheap would yield someone a lot of money.<br /><br />John Barrymore plays the Scotland Yard inspector and by dint of his name is top billed over John Howard as Drummond. It's a sad come down for Barrymore who reminds me of J.D. Cannon as Chief Clifford in the McCloud series, the way Drummond constantly shows up the Yard. He also has a little bit of Perry White thrown in as he constantly is telling people 'don't call me inspector'.<br /><br />The science is a bit bizarre and the plot has way too many holes in it.

"NO OTHER WOMAN started out as an interesting drama of a young woman and man in a steel town in love but with different ideas and different levels of intellect but startlingly turned midpoint into the most sexist film of the 1930's, with a jaw-dropping climax matched only by an equally outrageous finale.<br /><br />Irene Dunne is a lovely sensitive young woman in a steel town in love with the somewhat likable but coarse Charles Bickford. Irene dreams of escaping this dead end life but Bickford has no dreams other than being a big shot at the plant. Irene finds a soul mate in the somewhat younger Eric Linden, who studies and experiments with formulas on the side which Bickford ridicules. Dunne and Bickford marry but Irene hasn't quite given up on her dreams, taking in boarders and penny-pinching for the day they can move away. When Linden tells her of his discovery of a permanent dye she is thrilled that this may be their chance and wants to invest in it. Unfortunately, Bickford has had an apparent bad day at the plant and comes home in an angry mood and they have a big fight (apparently their first) and Bickford storms out to get good and drunk.<br /><br />Repentful the next day, he listens again to Irene's idea and becomes enthusiastic when he sees Eric's formula first hand and they start a business that brings them all fortune within a few years. Eventually the couple have a son but Bickford's business ventures keeps him away from home more often than not. While in New York, he falls into the lure of predatory Gwili Andre and they have a long-running affair which climaxes in Andre eventually demanding they end it or he leave Irene to marry her. After initial resistance, Bickford agrees but Irene, even after being publicly ridiculed (everyone knows about the affair it seems) refuses to grant him a divorce because she ""loves"" him to much to let him go.<br /><br />Things really start to get nasty when Bickford then sues her for divorce, alleging adultery on HER part and dragging her through the mud with paid-off ""witnesses"" who claim knowledge about Irene's ""affair"". Masochistic Irene however refuses to bring out HER knowledge about his affair into the proceedings since she is fighting the divorce. Bickford's lawyer paints her as a grasping, money-loving woman and even her earlier savings are used against her as ""proof"" of her love of money (quite oblivious to the fact that this money was the means to build Bickford's fortune.) When Bickford's lawyer announces Bickford is seeking full custody of their son and startled Irene erratically ""admits"" to the affair and then in hysteria proclaims their son is not Bickford's, no doubt in a desperate attempt to keep the child. Bickford finally is broken by his own selfishness and announces to the judge his story has all been a lie. Bickford is sentenced to a year in jail and their business collapses into bankruptcy over the scandal. Once released, Bickford goes back to work as a steel miller and is startled to find an all-forgiving Irene waiting to take him back as are his old friends, including Linden whom he has obviously also driven into bankruptcy.<br /><br />This is the ugliest ""love story"" I have ever seen in a film! Based on a 1916 play, this jaw-dropping tale of a woman who loves no matter what is just pathetic and it's horrible to see the lovely Irene Dunne in such a degrading role. This movie is ridiculous beyond belief. How is Irene able to save over $6,000 in a few years from her lower-working class husband's salary in the 1920's even with taking in boarders? How is the crude, unambitious, and unschooled Bickford able to have the brains to get a major corporation off the ground? Bickford gets only a year for such blatant premeditated perjury? And frankly given his selfish core, I couldn't help but think his ultimate confession was not caused by shame over what he had done to his wife but the possibility that his son would not be recognized as his own. <br /><br />The only good things I can think of saying about this film is the atmosphere in the early scenes is excellent, fully capturing the hot, steamy ambiance in a steel town, and Irene looks a vision in the glamorous fashions during the ""rich"" years. Seeing this beautiful, intelligent woman degraded with this story was too much for me but frankly I was just as disgusted with her character's all-forgiving attitude. Bickford gives a tired, rather over the top performance and it's no surprise he wasn't used very often as a leading man. Watching this unpleasant travesty would make even the most devoted film archivist wish this one were among the lost films.",Plot,,
"I watched the DVD knowing only vaguely that there are controversies regarding this film, but didn't know any of the particulars aside from the fact that it was gory. Well, it's a Mel Gibson movie after all, so that's a given.<br /><br />In short, Apocalypto is a beautiful, deeply moving presentation of a world that existed before Western contact, and was destroyed by it. After I watched the movie, I was dismayed to read reviews that charged it with being racist, that it depicted only the blood-thirsty brutality of Mayan savagery. But this is clearly not the case. The protagonist and his people demonstrate all the virtues that allow them to wear the ""white hats:"" they are intelligent, brave, loyal, and strong. They abide in a loving community and show great care and love of family and children. They're also a good looking bunch. <br /><br />The ""Black Hats"" are a dirty dozen if there ever were one -- the leader of the group reminded me of the Jack Palance character in Shane, but with a lot of human bone accouterments jangling about.

One characteristic of racism in films in that the depiction of the targeted race tends to be one- dimensional. Apocalypto is generously peopled with characters of great individual distinction, not cut-out characters. Another characteristic is that in a racist film is that it is we are to regard the targeted race with such disdain that we are not allowed to empathize with the villains or wear the villain's skin. But in Apocalypto we are as deeply engaged in Jaguar Paw's heroic quest as we are William Wallace's in Braveheart. <br /><br />Some reviewers have mistaken the arrival of the Spanish galleons as Gibson's intention to signify rescue and redemption from wanton bloodletting by Western ""civilization"" and Christianity, but this is getting things upside down. Don't we know by now that Cortes' arrival was the beginning of the brutal end of so many people and civilizations in America? If the ships were to signify rescue and redemption, Jaguar Paw would only have had to have been rescued right there on the beach. Great scene for a beach-side conversion, no? No. The film presents these dark ships as the foreboding vehicles of a continent-wide apocalypse.<br /><br />Okay, I do concede that if Apocalypto is primarily a movie ""about"" the Mayans, it fails because it is historically inaccurate. (The Mayans were gone long before Cortes' arrival -- it was the Aztecs that he managed to destroy.) But if it is, as I interpret it to be, about the many peoples, societies, and civilizations that were destroyed, that suffered an apocalyptic end on Western contact, then it puts faces in our historical picture where there have been only caricatures before.<br /><br />Update of 12/27/09: I was just reading through my reviews and have to update the fact that it took me a few days after posting the original for it to strike me that the film, while not racist, was sexist as heck. The women are not shown participating in any decision-making or the production or distribution of food or anything else. Their only real value is to serve as incubators for more Mayans. I apologize to my sisters for my blindness in this but ask them to take into consideration that I came back to correct myself without prompting or threats.",Plot,,

"The winner of Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes last night is the first feature-length film from Afghanistan. Shot by fledgling writer/editor/director, Siddiq Barmak, ""Osama,"" the film exposes the desperation and terror of a beautiful twelve-year-old girl (Marina Golbahari) during the Taliban era in Afghanistan. She becomes her widowed mother (Zubaida Sahar) and grandmother's only hope for survival since the Taliban rule decreed that her female family and thousands of others like them cannot appear in public without a male relative as escort. The Taliban has also decreed that women would not be permitted to work. <br /><br />The girl, her mother, and a young street urchin, Spandi, (Arif Herati) survive a violently suppressed demonstration launched by Afghan women. The girl and her mother had secretly worked in a hospital until the Taliban dismissed all the staff and closed its doors. Faced with imminent starvation, the girl's mother decides to disguise her daughter as a boy, so that she will have an opportunity to work. They decide upon the name Osama as the disguised young male. The film reaches critical mass when Osama, as a boy, along with Spandi, are taken to a Taliban training camp where it becomes increasingly difficult to keep her sex a secret. Marina Golbahari's innocent beauty and ability to express a wide range of emotions is sure to flower into the making of a talented and beautiful actress. <br /><br />The film is the epitome of everything negative surrounding the Muslim world's treatment of women. You cannot help but to despise the Taliban's inhuman treatment of women and the palpable fear that even the men experience in a land run by religious and hypocritical zealots. You could consider the film a downer, however, it plays like a thriller, with tensions kept high by focusing intently on the girl. It presents a believable and disturbing window into the soul of a society devastated by repression and war.<br /><br />Director Barmak shot this film on a shoestring budget with inexperienced actors, and created a cinematic masterpiece. He incredibly elicits professional performances from amateurs, building tension and intensity from the first opening scenes of the Taliban spraying crowds of women clad in shapeless blue Burkas. Since Barmak received much of his training in Iran, the film is typical of the Iranian style of filmmaking by ending abruptly with no resolution of the conflict. It is a film worthy of high praise; however, be prepared for experiencing a great deal of anger and anguish by witnessing the subjugation of Muslim women and children without much resolution or hope.<br /><br />Opens in the Bay Area on February 27, 2004 and on Feb. 6th in Los Angeles and New York",Performance,Plot,

"Sayaka is the new tenant of the fated Apartment 1303. After moving into her new apartment-which she got at a discounted price (sound familiar?), Sayaka kicks things off with a party. After visiting the ""Tatami room,"" she entertains her guests by eating dog food off the floor and donning a motorcycle helmet(?), she then leaps off the thirteen floor, plunging to her death.<br /><br />Sayaka's sister Mariko (Noriko Nakagoshi), is puzzled by her sisters sudden suicide. After some extremely long grieving scenes, Mariko decides to do some detective work. She quickly finds out that Sayaka was the fifth woman to die in the apartment, all of who died under similar circumstances. Her journey leads her to the apartment as well as a detective (Arata Furuta) who-for once-believes Mariko's story. Independently, the two set out to unravel the mystery of Apartment 1303 while trying not to become it's next victims.<br /><br />After watching the first few opening scenes in this movie, I thought this might be good. It seemed as if the director was doing kind of a parody of J-Horror. The death of Sayaka seemed to be ringed with campy overtones. From the goofy faces the characters made to the way things were overacted just a bit, to the weird death scene. Alas, it was not to be, besides the opening and a few scenes toward the end (which kind of reminded of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead 2... in style only) 1303 then degenerates into the typical J-horror flick, riddled with genre cliché's. <br /><br />Yes, this film has them all; scary dreams, phone calls from dead girls, a grudge type curse, a long haired vengeful ghost, and of course, the obligatory creepy little girl. Everything in this film is a mix of previous Asian horror films as Director Ataru Oikawa brings nothing new to the genre. I wish he would have followed the goofy beginning to it's logical next step (A spoof movie of Asian horror would be great if done right) but Oikawa instead elects to follow paths already forged out in J-Horror. <br /><br />Bottom Line- For genre fans only.

"Kamchatka is a terrible film. I believe what seems to pass for ""understated"" is its plain dullness, and the main character (a kid whose POV is nominally carrying the movie) doesn't show a single instance of child-like perception - save for a couple of commonplace animal shots, the kid sees the world exactly as the rest of Piñeyro's characters; a polite, well-framed shot by Alfredo Mayo.<br /><br />Since ""Caballos Salvajes"" I've been trying to figure out who the bad guys are in Piñeyro's films (back then, bullets always came from outside the frame). I'm sad to report things have gotten even worse, since now we need to resource to _our_ (external) knowledge of the period to understand what's going on. He seems to get away with it because, sadly, not that much happens in the movie, anyway.<br /><br />Kamchatka might be worth seeing, however, if you're interested in recent developments in the political genre. It was interesting to me how, by trying to detach itself from the political movie tradition, it achieves the complete opposite: this is a film that couldn't possibly make sense unless you are not only aware of the external circumstances that affect the characters but also have already a clear position on the political conflict in case.<br /><br />As justified as the generic, elegiac tone of the movie may be in the real world, its fictional consequences are devastating. It leaves us with no real characters and not a single dramatic scene proper.<br /><br />Characters here are archetypes and, most of the time, it's not entirely clear of what. It doesn't help that the movie looks often derivative of other films that have successfully portrayed the specifics of perception in children (the soundtrack mimicking Thomas Newman is particularly painful in that respect).<br /><br />Piñeyro's former writer (Aida Bortnik, who also wrote The Official Story) used to be quite annoying to me, but at least she seemed to know and like drama as a tool.",Performance,Directional Techniques,

Tucci co-directed with Scott, who plays a Cadillac salesman, the first time behind the lens for both and it shows in the form of some sloppy camera work. This is not a film to watch hungry as the last third of the film is devoted to a delectable feast. Unlike the feast, however, the film is somewhat unsatisfying.",Plot,,

"The scenes that ostensibly advance the ""plot"" are few an far between; punctuated by a jumbled mess of mock-documentary confessional scenes. The documentary segments might have been somewhat interesting, if only for their multi-national take on a common theme, except for the fact that they were edited in such a way as to jump from person to person within a topic, then back again, in no apparent order. The effect was to make it seem as though the director was attempting to s-t-r-e-t-c-h limited footage to take up more time. Not necessary, as it turned out, because the film seemed twice as long as it actually is.<br /><br />The big question here is whether the direction or editing is worse. I suppose the direction appears worse due to choppy editing; the editing was probably worsened by horrible direction.<br /><br />It is unfair to judge the acting ability of either Daryl Hannah or Denise Richards based upon this film.

If the bullet goes off, they loose. If it does not, then the new member is welcomed. In this case, the bullet goes off on one of the two newest members and the rest of the group looks on at her horrified. The story continues as seven years after the incident, each member of the group gets an invitation to a reunion along with a bunch of cash and is asked to meet at a hotel. After each member meets at their destination, two guys come up and escort them to their final meeting place wherever that is. The girls go along and the guys drive them to a resort and they are all welcomed to the place with a pool, parties and a welcoming sighn. As the girls have their fun, the two guys go back to join in the fun. But the owner of the resort has other plans up his sleeve as to what to do with the girls once they arrive and it was part of the plan for the guys to leave and never come back. In which a gate to the resort is closed and lined with electric barbbed wire. The man turns out to be the father of the slain girl killed seven years ago and it is his plan to kill each member one by one. The guys in this movie that weren't supposed to be part of this plot didn't fit in with the movie. they were a waste of time and should have left after they dropped them off because they were totally out of place. At the end of the movie, one of the girls is faced with the father and she tells him a tale of how his daughter planed on killing herself anyway and told the person that fired the gun to go ahead and kill her off anyway. This does not make any sense sense the shooter was supposed to be witness as to who rigged the fake bullet and place a real one in it's place. Then the very last part of the film in which the surviver of the cult pulls a gun to one of the guys and says she is the last one to leave and fires off the gun just left me dumbfounded.

It is the soundtrack, however, that brings this beauty together- the songs as well as the musical scores are catchy, beautifully composed and thoroughly breathtaking. The story has not been 'dumbed down' or watered down. It is accessible to children without alienating other generations and it humanises the characters wonderfully. The only thing in the entire film I found difficult was the pronunciation of Aaron's name- but that is obviously minor, it just took me a while to 'get' if that makes sense.<br /><br />It's amazing, beautiful wonderful the art, music and sheer intelligence of the story will blow you away.",Music,,

"It starts off just as it is expected to with all the clichés about India. Yes, there are cows on street but it is hard to believe one in a call-centre campus. In fact, it's hard to believe a call-centre office in a rural hinterland with callers having heavy first-language influence. I believe only GOOD speakers of English are recruited by these firms and they don't change their outsourcing plans overnight. Travellers who make an impression of India based on this film may be pleasantly surprised if they actually visit the cities of India.<br /><br />Anyway, what got this movie really working is an interesting storyline, interspersed with comments and questions about cultures on both side of the 'divide'. I'm not sure but it seems like the director / writer was pointing at issues here with outsourcing as a backdrop: 1. That there are PEOPLE (humans) working in companies - this is often overlooked by bosses remotely controlling company operations. This is not limited to call-centres and may not be limited to India. Just as in the movie, several jobs may be put to risk at any time by a ""20 heads for the price of 1"" logic. Right now, we in India are facing the same issue with the rise of ""cheap"" workers in the Philippines, who may be doing a good job a few years down the line.<br /><br />2. Several other interactions and incidents in the movie seemed to say - there are humans involved. Sensitivity is required in handling human issues, for example, the spiritual undertone of the characters or the surprise at ""calf-branding"".<br /><br />3.

This makes this movie even better than it started out to be.<br /><br />Lastly, in case you decide to visit India after watching this movie, plan your travel well and just like any other part of the world, stay alert.

"This American Psycho 2 movie gets its audience of its name, which is one of the appealing ones int he field today. The name is just a lame attempt to cover up a bad movie, which worked for me, because i rented it. Having not seen the first American Psycho, i thought this would be as good as the Psycho-series was said to be, but this was just a lousy sequel for a lousy series. AP2 is a generic teen-slasher without the intensity of any kind. Murders are done without a feeling, and are often cencored using different camera angles. <br /><br />The acting itself isn't bad, but the characters are left shallow and predictable. The main character's actress was simply not beliavable in her role of a psycho.Who can honestly believe that some 18 -year old college girl could be a cold-blooded murderer? <br /><br />In fact the whole idea of having a cute Mila as the psycho is not from this planet. It just don't work! She's from the 70's show for crying out loud! the folks who wrote the story have lost their sense of reality and it shows.<br /><br />In Carrie 2 the character was much more believable, but then again this movie plays in the same league of bad movies.

More importantly it felt like the murders didn't take place at all, because the murder scenes didn't have any intensity or feelings involved. Every murder was such a cliché, and very predictable, just like the dialogue, the places and the plot.<br /><br />The music was poor, it didn't create suitable atmosphere for the movie in overall. There was something very American in this movie: it was stupid. In some part there is some really patriotic song playing, something in ""God bless America"" - style.

Wheeler was considerably smaller in stature and weighed maybe half as much. There are pictures of Gen. Wheeler standing with TR and Col. Wood, both of which were taller and heavier. The movie does not depict the intense heat in Cuba in July with near enough severity. The heat was unbearable and went a large amount toward the reason for the incredibly high disease rate. Rough Riders as well as the other soldiers of the Cuban Campaign were 8-10 times more likely to die of malaria and dysentery than from being shot in combat. The movie spent only a little time on this.",Plot,,
"I wasn't sure what to expect going in to the movie. I had watched a preview for it here on IMDb and thought that it seemed like an interesting story. Boy was I wrong! The acting in this ""movie"" is some of the worst I've ever witnessed in ANY movie. Another reason I had decided to rent this is because one of the other users here who had posted a review made a comment about how great the acting was. She must've been high, because this was laughable. The two hippy women were probably the worst of the bunch but the loudmouthed punk kid was right up there, too.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to Helen Keller. The story is so lame that it'll have you squirming in your seat. Stuck in traffic because of downed power lines and a man who refuses to move his wrecked car? Okay, here's an idea...TURN YOUR CAR AROUND AND GO BACK THE WAY YOU CAME!!! Jeez. I wanted to scream.<br /><br />Watch this movie you you want but don't expect it to be any more interesting than watching paint dry.",Performance,,
"This is a zombie movie comedy, it's not a horror film by any stretch of the imagination. Of course, neither are most zombie films. People can't really be ""scared"" by all this silliness, can they? Anyhow, round up the usual bunch of rednecks and let some zombies loose in their town. Hilarity ensues. The local TV station is reporting on the zombies - a redneck calls up and complains that they preempted the basketball game. One guy says ""It's the end of the world"". Another guy says ""Well, it isn't the end of that whiskey bottle. Mind if I have a swig?"" You get the idea. People are comparing this to Shawn of the Dead - this is ten times better. I laughed on quite a few occasions during this movie. I changed the channel 1/2 hour into Shawn. That movie was garbage.<br /><br />This film even shows a surprising amount of intelligence. One guy is lamenting the loss of his '64 1/2 Mustang which he had just finished restoring. You'll never, EVER hear mention of such a thing in a Hollywood movie because they assume that the audience is way too stupid to know what a 64 1/2 Mustang is, and they would become confused and disoriented.<br /><br />The acting is really low-key, everyone just takes the zombies in stride, dealing with them much like they would a herd of cattle that got loose and began roaming around town. One guy, who's house is surrounded by zombies, goes outside to get something from his truck. Upon returning, his wife excitedly asks: ""What have you decided to do!"". ""Oh, I wasn't deciding anything"" he says, ""I just went out to my truck to get my beer"".<br /><br />Overall, this is a delightful little film with a lot of originality and - gasp! - it's actually funny.

"I stayed after the film for a Q & A with the director in the hopes that he could explain the film. In fact, someone even yelled from the rear of the theater, for an explanation. All the filmmaker could say was that he was a fan of surreal films. This was apparently his bow to surrealism. That didn't explain the awkward editing, the jumping from one point in the time line to another, the not knowing what was real and what was imagined, nor the confusing film in general. I will say the two leads acted well, and looked even better. I'd love to see what they could do in another film.

"A whimsically breezy surface makes way for a bang-up, ball-breaking and noisy spaghetti western by the talented Sergio Corbucci (the man also behind ""The Great Silence"" and ""The Mercenary""). Actually I might still put those two films ahead of this one. Hell, there was an explosion of excitement ringing from this this highly competent and vivid outing. The cheeky style dripping from the fascinating material was well placed and delivered. Even from the action, the grand state of it feels like something out of a comic strip and how can't you love the flat-out, bloodthirsty machine gun activity towards the finale. What a sensational climax it builds up to! <br /><br />The trio of Franco Nero, Tomas Milian and Jack Palance were nothing but marvellous, and the chemistry between the former two was a blast. But Palance's sophisticatedly leering menace was the real draw-card. Fernando Rey makes for a solid turn too. Ennio Morricone plucks in with a gleefully passionate and killer music score, which is one of his best and the rugged location was captured by Alejandro Ulloa's free-flowing and expressive cinematography that had plenty of poignant scope and detail. Corbucci stews up some inventive directorial flushes amongst the grit, chaos and exuberance. The atmospheric setting hit's the spot and sets up many potboiler and comedic scenes. It can lull at times, and might feel somewhat overlong.<br /><br />The hard-boiled story sticks to something rather stable and less than flashy, but can be thoughtful in its wide arrange of antics and tactics. It's gusty political sub-text (on the treatment of the poor and use of violence to get your point across) can get a bit wishy-washy and preachy, however it definitely makes up for it in other areas like the chewy script with its constant wit and surprises.<br /><br />Over-the-top entertainment equals a totally baroque and enjoyable Corbucci spaghetti western.",Directional Techniques,Performance,Music
"Although I try not to miss any episode of ""7 vidas"" now, I have to say that I never watched it on its first seasons. However, the impression I have is that, like it happens with wine, this sitcom has been getting better and better throughout the years. Does anyone really remember that its initial premise was the awakening of a young man who had been in a coma since his late teens?<br /><br />Nowadays ""7 vidas"" portrays the lives of a bunch of people of different ages and backgrounds who constitute an atypical group of friends. However, the plot is the least important feature in this series, since it's mostly based on its humor. Puns, witty remarks, some physical comedy and an ironic view of Spanish society make a few millions of Spaniards await their weekly share of ""7 vidas"". <br /><br />Amparo Baro is the heart and soul of the series, but very few remember that her character was originally a supporting one. Blanca Portillo and Anabel Alonso have proved their great ability as comediennes, but the great discovery here has been unknown Carmen Machi, who had mostly worked in theater before and is now heading for a spin-off based on her character, Aida. Javier Cámara and Guillermo Toledo are sorely missed since they decided to leave the series, but new faces like Santi Millán or Santi Rodriguez have managed to keep viewers stuck to their TVs.<br /><br />This is, in fact, the live proof that a witty, well-written series can actually be successful in our country, and I hope it will still run for a few more years to come.",Plot,Performance,
"When action scenes for ""Gypsy Moths"" were about to be shot, mostly at the Benton,Kansas airfield, I was 18 and living in Wichita. Due to my interest in acting, mainly in High School productions, I, along with my five brothers and sisters and Mother who was a bit of a ham herself, answered a ""cattle call"" for crowd scenes at Benton Airfield. Because I was Burt Lancaster's general height and build and was the same size, 42 Long, I was upgraded to Stand-in for him and ended up standing in for all the principle male characters except Gene Hackman who used his brother. There was a scene in a park in El Dorado, KS where Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster sit on a merry-go-round and talk. He then stands up and leans in rather closely to Ms. Kerr. The director wanted to change the lighting on that particular shot to compensate for Mr. Lancaster's new position. He called for the ""Seconds"" to take the actors' places while they fine tuned the lighting. At that moment Deborah's stand-in was over by the swings, in the process of losing the greasy chili which had been catered that night and couldn't answer the call. John Frankenheimer was upset by her failure to report and acted like he was about to fire her, but, always the gracious lady, Ms. Kerr said she was fine just sitting there and would stand in for herself. The scene required that Burt Lancaster lean in to the point that their faces are mere inches apart. There she was, the consummate professional and I, standing in for Mr. Lancaster, was face to face with an actress I had loved ever since seeing her in such films as ""From Here to Eternity"" and ""The King and I"". It's understating my uneasiness by saying I was sweating bullets and worrying about my breath. She sensed my discomfort and proceeded to ask me questions like what I aspired to be (she didn't say 'when I grew up', which was, to me, just more evidence of her class) to set me at ease. At the time I was very interested in an acting career and she said that if I ever got to Hollywood to look her up and she would get me an appointment with her agent. What amazed me about the exchange was that I realized she was serious and would very probably have taken the time out of her busy schedule to do just that. My esteem for her grew many fold that night. Although I understand she now lives in Switzerland, I have often thought that even though I am in my 50's and gave up the thought of acting professionally years ago, it would be great if she still lived in Hollywood and I was able contact her. I would remind her of what she said 36 years ago and ask when she would be able to take me to see her agent. At 85 years old, I wouldn't be surprised if she said, ""Give me a couple of minutes and we'll go over right now."" Deborah Kerr, I still love you and I always will.",Performance,,
"After watching ""Killer Bees!"" on television one night, I nearly decided to renounce modern technology altogether. The ""bees"" were just laughable as special effects go. Now, I understand that generating an effect that simulates the Brownian-like motion of a swarm is challenging, but the result here was very unnatural looking. The townspeople, in contrast, were very lifelike. Some of them almost seemed to be living, sentient beings. Amazing!<br /><br />I think it would have been a better show if we had never seen the bees. Maybe there could have been some pack of dogs roaming the town, picking out the sick and the weak. That's scary. This was just sad.",Visual Effect,,

"I'm going to guess that 'Cutting Class' became a cult classic only because it stars a very young pretty boy that we all know as Brad Pitt. I sure can't see any other value in this awful movie. It makes Student Bodies (a hilarious horror parody) look like 'The Godfather.'<br /><br />First off, this is not much of a horror movie. About ninety percent of the movie plays out like an after school special, focusing on the troubled life of the aggressive pretty boy, Dwight (Brad Pitt). He's the jock who often finds himself competing with former mental hospital patient, Brian Woods (Donovan Leitch) for the attention of the classic horror movie virgin, Paula (Jill Schoelen). Basically, the material is so cliché, it's not even interesting. At least with Student Bodies, they turned the cliché into a parody and were willing to make fun of themselves for being such a bad movie. Here, they couldn't even give us that benefit of the doubt. But, we get this long boring story about these three main characters that seems to have no point, except to draw your attention every now and then to the campus killer, who conveniently cuts into the act (no pun intended...i guess). I suppose that the filmmakers thought it necessary to remind you of that, just in case you forgot. Look, there's that dang killer again. He's gone and killed the best friends. Or the teacher who gave our characters hell. It's definitely a horror movie by the book. Yes, word for word.<br /><br />I like how Martin Mull, who plays Paula's father and the first victim of the killer, is shot by a archery arrow and is left bleeding, but manages to survive like this for days. When the kids are in the woods around the creek where he's fallen, wounded, he can't manage to let out more than a dying breath to try and get someone's attention to help him. Of course, no one does. But later, possibly after another day has passed, he manages to get up and walk all the way home and then scold his daughter for not being in class. If that doesn't just wreak of stupidity...<br /><br />But the end all be all of this awful movie is the worst dialogue, especially at the end. And performed in such a way that it's almost like they're reading from cue cards off-stage. They pause, then say their stupid line (and I can't decide which character is more ridiculous--Brian or Paula), then we have another awkward pause, and so forth. The finale on the whole is just completely stupid. <br /><br />I guess, there's no point in continuing. If you want to see Brad Pitt in an early role, I would definitely recommend watching something else (Dark Side of the Sun was a good one, but hard-to-find). Otherwise, you'll find plenty of him here as capital moron, D(uh!)wight. As far as teen horror movies go, the 80s gave us plenty of them, good ones in fact.

I just have to wonder, at the end of this, was Charlie's Angels really that boring? I don't seem to remember it as such. But this movie, as bad as movies of this type can be, bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show. I did see it all, in spite of the negatives, it wasn't unwatchable. But it was very bland, which I do not fault the performers for at all, particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them. The movie just wasn't that interesting. It tried to make each angel a ""character"". (One angel is to feisty, one is the ""good girl"", one is to into her husband....),all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes.

"Ask a film buff for the worst disaster film of all time and you might get answers like The Swarm, Meteor, City on Fire, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure or Avalanche. But in reality the very worst of all is this incredulously awful Irwin Allen debacle. It has a wonderful cast, which in some ways makes its utter awfulness even more surprising and unacceptable. This is one of the worst films from any genre.<br /><br />Paul Newman heads the cast, and has a red tinge to his cheeks throughout which may either be sunburn or embarrassment. He is the chief oil driller on a volcanic Pacific island who suspects that a catastrophic eruption is a matter of days away. However, the island relies on its tourist industry, and business bigwigs like William Holden (great actor, never more wasted than he is here) won't heed the warnings and insist on keeping people on the island. The eruption arrives, as anticipated by Newman, and the tourists are left to run for their lives from its clutches. Newman finds himself leading one group of evacuees, made up of the usual clichéd characters. The group includes some great stars, like Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Burgess Meredith and Jacqueline Bisset, but anyone with a brain can figure out with a degree of certainty which ones are going to make it and which are doomed.<br /><br />The action is marred constantly by terrible special effects. The actors are critically defeated by banal dialogue and actions. The suspense element of the film fails also, because it takes way too long to get going and is thoroughly predictable once it finally kicks into gear.

I've personally never seen a film that is so raw, down at heel and realistic, almost like the cameraman followed these people around and simply filmed the horrors they go through... no cheese, no pretensions simply raw and unflinching in its portrayal. i have no other choice to give this bleak, dark sad and enthralling movie 10/10... hoping its stock will rise in years to come. definitely not for kids, and anybody else easily offended, but marvellous entertainment.",Directional Techniques,,

"SPOILERS<br /><br />Yes, yes, I know this is not a Holiday show, let alone movie, but I really wanted to comment on it. This show is created by who else than Matt Groening, who obviously created the Simpsons. Although it may not be as good as the Simpsons it is still a fantastic comedic cartoon. The characters in Futurama also have overbites like the characters in the Simpsons. The characters are not yellow, though. As you know by now, Futurama takes place in the future, so there are robots, aliens, one-eyed aliens that look like regular humans, people from Mars that look like regular people, one hundred sixty year old men, and much, much more. The future contains tubes that suck people to places, booths that can kill you, and hover cars. <br /><br />A pizza delivery boy named Fry who goes out to deliver pizza. It is almost the year 2000. At the place where he is supposed to deliver the pizza he falls into a freezer. He is frozen. One thousand years go by. It is the year 3000. When he thaws out he is flabbergasted at what he sees. He learns that his nephew Professor Farnsworth lives close by. He meets a robot named Bender. All he does is drink and smoke cigars. He meets Leela, a one-eyed alien that looks like a regular human. She chases him to make him get his delivery job. He finds Farnsworth. Bender, Leela, and Fry become delivery people, alien, and robot. Fry also meets Amy, Hermes, and Dr. Zoidberg. All of them go on zany adventures.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic cartoon. Although it may not be as good, it's still great. I never found this show to be as funny as the Simpsons, though. I mean, there's laugh-out-loud moments, but just no as much as the Simpsons had. I also found some endings to Futurama are incredibly sad and depressing. Some of the endings include the ending to Jurassic Bark, when a flashback shows that Fry's dog in the past had waited next to the pizza parlour for Fry to return for the rest of his life. I mean, it's so sad, the dog had waited for him. The dog's eyes were so sad and hopeful. Also the end in Time Keeps on Slipping was really depressing.

"As far as movies go, this one has what is popular: action, adventure, sex, blood, and lots of twists that will keep you guessing what the truth is.<br /><br />However, if you've read Beowulf (which, judging by the reviews, is a small number of people), and you appreciate the characters and hold them in a place of dignity and respect in your mind, then forget about appreciating anything about the movie. Though Beowulf is portrayed in the epic as the great leader and hero who never has done a dishonorable deed, he is, in the movie, portrayed as a liar and a deceiver. He defeats Grendel by closing his arm in a door. He never kills Grendel's mother because she seduces him and together, they beget the Dragon. How does this even make any sense? He returns to the Geats claiming to have defeated Grendel's mother and is then made king by Hrothgar. This is, of course, good for Beowulf, because he has a thing for Wealtheow, Hrothgar's wife, anyway. The kind and noble King Hrothgar has also been degraded to a cheating husband who also sleeps with Grendel's mother (hence the existence of Grendel) and who end up killing himself after making Beowulf king. the only noble deed that Beowulf seems to achieve (in the movie) is by severing his own arm from his body and by tearing out the dragon's heart with his bare hand (neither of which is in the book, by the way.) Funny, in the book, I don't remember the fight with the dragon leaving the cave at all...<br /><br />We can only pray that someday someone does this epic justice and makes a decent film out of it.

"Now, don't get me wrong: the movie by itself wasn't *that* bad, it was just horrible (no, not in *that* way) in the Hellraiser context. The problem, you see, is the following: the first half of the series (yes, even the 4th installment which most people dislike) were monster-movies - a mysterious box, a couple of evil looking beings that came with it, and a lot of unlucky people who came in contact with them - while ""Inferno"" and the rest have been turned into mind game movies, where people see things which may, or may not, be related to the box...<br /><br />What we have in ""Hellworld"" is a genuine mediocre teen slasher: 5 young people, who were once dedicated players of the Internet based game ""Hellworld"" but are taking it cooler since the suicide of their fellow player, get invited to a big party. From the beginning things seem weird and soon our heroes start to die one by one... And that's it. Pinhead, once a scary creature from Hell, has basically been turned into a serial killer with minimum imagination. The whole ""you dared to open the box, we came, now you'll be tortured for all eternity"" is gone. It's quite obvious that this script wasn't written with Hellraiser in mind. It's actually a mystery why it was even made part of the series, when it'd worked quite nicely independently... It could have used more deaths though.<br /><br />I have to mention two positive things about the movie: Lace (hey, it doesn't matter if it's a brilliant masterpiece or Z-class production when Lance is in it!) and the fact that everybody was familiar with the Hellraiser mythology (the main character Chelsea even mentions that cenobites could never attack her because she would never open the box... beside the fact that it's all just fiction).<br /><br />But all in all I'd give it a 4 out of 10 - not enough deaths, lame story, has virtually nothing to do with the Hellraiser franchise, but the deaths were OK and Lace played along.",Plot,,

There is no justification whatsoever for the writer promoting this kind of behaviour and the film completely ignores the misery and suffering that the paedophile's victim endures throughout.<br /><br />I strongly advise anyone looking for thoughtful and insightful cinema to look elsewhere The History Boys is like Trojan horse, on the outside seemingly fun and innocent tale of adolescence and academic but underneath is a dangerous and sickening endorsement of child molestation spearheaded by the writers vile sodomite agenda.",Plot,,

"I haven't had so much fun watching a movie for a long time. The General is a silent comedy (mostly slapstick) about Johnny Gray, a train engineer with two loves: his engine and Annabelle Lee. Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War (they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer). Things are then sped up a year, where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan. As it so happens, they steal Johnny's engine, a big mistake.<br /><br />Buster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny. His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy. He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies (but, of course, less old). He is often ignorant of what is going on around him, leading to plenty of laughs. This also makes him a very charismatic character.<br /><br />There are countless train related jokes. The first one comes right at the beginning, when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman, in a line much like a train. The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train, either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers. The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful. The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment. The finale is explosive.<br /><br />The General was a lot of fun to watch. It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies, and had plenty of substance on top of that. This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever. After my first viewing, it instantly became one of my favorites. It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies.",Performance,,
"I saw it when it came out in the eighties and I have it in vivid memory as an extraordinary experience. The quiet telling of an intriguing life, and the very way the story unfolds. Wendy Hiller does excellent work here and the gallery around her is the true British tradition of character description. It is one of the very few cases, where I went out and bought the book, and the book disappointed me. It is one of my highest priorities as a DVD and it is crying shame, if this mini series is forgotten. The story begins at the funeral of her husband and her consequent decision to live out the rest of her days according to her own wishes after a long life as the wife of a very successful politician. Prime minister and viceroy of India among his accomplishments. We get retrospective insights in her perception of this life, but the very amusing part is the description of her family's reaction to her buying a house on Hampstead Heath and not wishing visits from anybody below 40! With on exception, a granddaughter, whom the family subsequently tries to bully unto spying! This story is sheer delight, and i sincerely hope to see it on DVD soon",Plot,,

However, the writing and editing were so disjointed, and it seemed like there were too many subplots going on for any one story line or character to get any substantial development.<br /><br />Unless you have kids who are dying to see this, I would skip it altogether or wait for it to come out on DVD.

"Real Time, the second feature of writer/director Randall Cole (19 Months) made its Canadian debut at the Toronto International Film Festival after being the opening night feature at the Slamdance Festival earlier this year. <br /><br />Opening with a twitchy, expletive-laden, nervous tirade, Ottawa's Jay Baruchel (Knocked Up, Million Dollar Baby) gives the best performance of his young career as Andy Hayes; a doomed gambling addict bemoaning his constant bad luck. <br /><br />Pulling up alongside Andy in his big black Town Car is Aussie ex-pat Reuben played by Randy Quaid (The Last Detail, Brokeback Mountain) who gives another in a long career filled with excellent performances. Glancing up at Reuben's car, Andy quickly turns on his heel and walks in the opposite direction down the sidewalk to which Reuben calmly puts the car in reverse. Thus begins a hilarious pas-de-deux between man and car on a grey street in Hamilton. <br /><br />After a stern invitation, Andy reluctantly gets in the car where we discover that we will be spending much of the last hour and a half of his life with him. Quaid's Reuben quietly explains that he has been given the assignment of killing Andy, but will give him until 3pm to get his affairs in order. <br /><br />Thus our adventure begins, with director Cole cleverly echoing Hal Ashby's 'The Last Detail' in which Quaid takes on the Nicholson role of guiding his young charge in the last moments before an inevitable fate is to befall him. <br /><br />Both of these character actors are clearly relishing the freedom afforded them by having lead roles in this excellent comedic drama. Quaid's hit man is kind, thoughtful, and contemplative all the while simmering with potential violence, while occasionally flashing a glimpse of the goofy grin we first saw from him in Peter Bogdanovich's 'The Last Picture Show'. Baruchel brilliantly portrays the sadness all too common in people who choose not to engage beyond the perfunctory with the world at large. <br /><br />Even as events unfold in real time, there is a surreal timelessness evoked as we glide along dilapidated streets, with Reuben as our guide, while a radio station that will bring a smile to the lips of anyone who has a soft spot for 70s Can Con plays innocently along the way. <br /><br />With cats (both dead and alive), unspeakable acts on potato salad, a somewhat addled shut-in Grandma (national treasure, Jayne Eastwood) and horizontal urination, there are plenty of laughs throughout; despite the serious subject matter in Real Time. <br /><br />While the film is full of razor-sharp dialogue, writer/director Cole also allows us space, as we are driven through the beautifully shot ugliness of The Hammer's streets, in which Quaid & Baruchel draw us into their messed up worlds, to this point in time. <br /><br />This thoughtful film invites us to examine how we choose to spend our time, as Andy contemplates a life that has lead him deep into a thick woods with Reuben's gun at his back <br /><br />This film will stay with you long after the credits roll. You will be glad you spent these 79 minutes in Real Time.",Performance,Plot,
"I loved watching this show back when it first aired, and I loved watching it recently on DVD.<br /><br />I noticed that as the show came to an end, that 3 episode in particular seemed as attempted spin-off pilots for some of the cast.<br /><br />Season 5 Episode 19 ""Lost Resort"" Seemed like a pilot for a Willie Aames spin-off series.<br /><br />Season 5 Episode 23 ""Almost Family"" Seemed like an Ellen Travolta spin-off attempt.<br /><br />And Season 5 Episode 25 ""Fair Exchange"" looked like a Nicole Eggert spin-off pilot.<br /><br />Is it just me, or did these really do look like Pilot Episodes for shows that never came to be? All 3 were directed by Scott Baio, so they might of just been attempts by him to get into the director's chair, or it might of been in his contract and the producers let him do whatever he wanted. But they seemed like spin-offs to me. Of course, they never came to be. Of the 3 the only one I think would of had a chance at a half season is Fair Exchange, but, the acting was terrible in it. This shows how worse the other two were. All in all, they were interesting concepts, maybe with a re-format they might of gotten picked up.",Performance,Plot,

The beginning of the movie starts out to look promising. The middle(longest part by a long shot)is so incredibly lacking in feel and scare factor, I was bored to death. The third part almost started feeling like they were going to leave us with a heart ripping adventure in to Samaras world. Only to be another boring, uninspired, and barely scary rendition of a scare movie. One part that should have brought a jump and a scare made me laugh and shake my head and say to myself, the scare is gone. Such a bummer this film was so poor.

"This is not a very good musical. So much is lacking: the lead actor can't dance enough for the big production number, the lead actress can dance but is downright homely (there's a point in the script where she says she used to be the ugliest girl in such-and-such a town before Ray Walston turned her into a vamp, and one can't help but think, gosh, is this the best he could do? It makes the devil seem damn weak.) That young Tab Hunter is so pretty makes her uglier in comparison--just bad, bad, casting. (She no doubt looked leggy and good from a second balcony, but on screen--gah!) Most of the dancing is dull, shockingly enough to this Fossy choreography fan, until the big drunken production number. And the songs aren't good at all.<br /><br />What's better about it is that the plot (until the illogical ending) is an engaging baseball-Faust, Tab Hunter is sweet and adorable as Shoeless Joe, Ray Walston is as terrific as he always is, and the wardrobe is quite good.<br /><br />But since a major thrust of the plot is Lola's attempted seduction of Joe, and she's just so awfully homely, the plot is weakened. That leaves Ray Walston being devilish and Tab Hunter being aw-shucks cute--perhaps enough to support a straight comedy, but not nearly enough to support a musical-comedy.<br /><br />The same group of songwriters, etc. did Pajama Game, which is a much better musical, with a couple wonderful songs. Knowing this one had run for several years on Broadway, I had hoped for something as good as Pajama Game but was disappointed.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
"After watching this movie, I realized something. Movies like 'Less Than Zero' (more so in Bret Easton Ellis' novel than the movie, though) and 'Bonfire of the Vanities' and other similarly themed movies presents one class of people, wealthy apathetic socialites who exist in a state of perpetual uselessness. 'Slacker' presents the other extreme. Young people in their twenties in this small Texas town with zero prospects, zero interest, and a lot to say about nothing. They're so hell bent on some kind of 'anti-establishment' philosophy, that they completely consume themselves in absolute drivel. Sort of like, rebelling too much about something they really know nothing about. No tough lives, nothing. Just person after person pontificating about absolute nonsense. These kind of people aren't profound philosophers, but instead, are just as useless as the obscenely wealthy bonvivants of the films of the 80s.<br /><br />I don't think 'Slacker' is a celebration of that type of character either, since most of the people in the movie, at least to me, come off as giant idiots. I think it was the intention of the filmmakers to mock that, although I don't remember the early 90s enough to conclude that based on its original context. The movie drags on and on, passing from one person to the next in this small Texas town, doing their bit before the camera before it passes them over and travels on to the next. They're not particularly interesting and to me, and in fact, are annoying enough to give someone the homicidal twitch. If you can tolerate the near hour and a half of convoluted yammering of the characters (because that's all there is), then you'll probably be able to get through it. Once was enough for me.",Plot,,
"I heard my parents talking about this TV movie that they felt was a little too violent and scary to have been shown on national TV. According to them, it would have been better for cable. That TV movie was 'Something is Out There'. They had taped it so they could watch some dumb sitcom instead. I felt a nagging urge to see what it was they were talking about.<br /><br />Man were they ever right. Not only was it really gory and freaky to boot, but it was one of the coolest TV films I've ever seen. You've got the mysterious killer mutilating NY residents, the hot chick who claims to be from from outer space, the drunk/loser detective, and one of the nastiest villains to ever grace the small screen.<br /><br />#1, I was taken for a loop. I thought the killer was jsut an ordinary psycho who loved to eviscerate joggers... but when it turns out to be an psychopathic alien fugitive that can disguise itself as anyone it wants, I was put into a mild state of shock.<br /><br />#2, For a TV film, the FX are awesome (for the time period). This was before the computer FX revolution, so they look 'real'. The alien villain is actually a very sweet looking puppet that is frighteningly insectiod-like.<br /><br />#3, The characters are fleshed out completely making the viewer actually care about them. The acting is impressive as well (especially the luscious<br /><br />Maryam d'Abo).<br /><br />#4, Man is this thing sick. I have to give credit to the director, he's got balls. People get ripped apart from the inside out by the alien constantly in this flick. Not only that, but we get some nasty views of the alien's early victims that it was studying, plus some gross after the fact corpses.<br /><br />In the end, this is probably one of my favorite TV movies... or movies period. Where is this on DVD dammit! It was actually turned into a short lived television series featuring the same characters and actors, but the cool alien killer was nowhere to be found, thus making it pretty worthless.<br /><br />If it's ever shown on TV again, watch it... you won't regret it!",Performance,Plot,

If you've read the other reviews then you know the focus: a self-involved film maker wants to introduce you to his sexual habits.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his sexual habits aren't very interesting or original or even entertaining. There isn't much sex on display here, just a lot of talk about sex, and you've heard it before. He does a lot of agonizing about his relationships, and possibly doesn't know himself that he just comes off as a fool. Not in a funny way, either, but in that way where you're glad he doesn't live near you, or isn't involved with anyone you know.<br /><br />Mainly it's a self-indulgent documentary about his past sexual relationships with nothing interesting to carry it. An extended version of the average high schooler telling you about how he scored with the cheerleader. You won't believe it here, either.",Plot,,

It simply has gone downhill fast in this iteration of the Miss Marple series.<br /><br />I have written PBS and explained my disapproval and they simply tell me that new ideas are refreshing. Makes me think PBS needs new people.<br /><br />Since so many people on this site and others have voiced how bad it is you would think it would be heard by PBS and others. Of course, in a world where you live or die by the number of viewers, such as in commercial TV, it would be heard. Not necessarily taken off the air because i don't know its ratings.

"I don't know if I'll ever see another Wallace Beery picture as bad as this one. I hope not, but I'm sure he made some other dogs. Usually Beery can be counted on to bring the laughs, and do something memorable with his character.<br /><br />Beery's is not the worst performance in this piece (that distinction belongs to Lionel Barrymore, obviously loathe to be in this production and cantankerously chewing the scenery with noisy and irritating aplomb like nowhere else on his filmography) but he offers little more than updating his Pancho Villa schtick from Viva Villa. Not much originality or send-up in his performance and he doesn't even appear until around the 30 minute mark. He does look cartoonishly amusing galloping away with the Mexican Federales in hot pursuit though.<br /><br />This really isn't a funny comedy or a watchable western. At 70 minutes it feels overlong. Everyone stands in one spot and talks endlessly, Ronald Reagan does the hero bit with his usual one dimensional panache, Barrymore won't shut up, and the oppressive sepia tone this was shot in kind of makes you queasy by the end. Chill Wills at least is his usual lovable self as Reagan's sidekick.<br /><br />Definitely not a Beery classic",Performance,,
"I grew up watching the old Disney movies, and Bambi has always been one of my favorites. When I first saw that they were making a new Bambi movie, I was really torn. I hoped that it would be a good follow-up, but was afraid that it would ruin the whole Bambi experience.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie, though not as good as the original is far surpassing many Disney sequels.<br /><br />The animation quality is good. Not only is it much better than most of Disney's recent sequels, it is is actually up to, and at some points even surpassing, the animation in the original. The songs were beautiful, and to my immense relief, they are all sung in the background in the style of the original. There is only one point at which any of the animals sing. It was extremely cheesy, but mercifully short.<br /><br />The only real failing of this movie is that it lacks the fresh, genuine feeling of the original. While Bambi I felt unique and novel, Bambi II often feels cliché and it seems like they are recycling some material from The Lion King. The addition of Ronno as an antagonist adds nothing to the story but goofiness and low-quality humor. The Great Prince's character seems to be the caricature ""single dad"" struggling to understand his kid. And while Bambi's character has always been humanized (as are all animals in Disney movies) he seems far more ""human"" and much less ""animal"" than he did in the original.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this movie, and was able to get a few nostalgic moments. Although it does not quite live up to the original, it is nevertheless a sweet and enjoyable movie.",Performance,Plot,
"The reason I gave this awful film a 4 instead of a 1 is the wonderful cinematography. This film is beautifully captured in its brilliant colors and wonderful landscapes. Unfortunately, the main character in this is practically unwatchable. The first time you notice that something is wrong is when we get our first closeup of our heroine. For living out in Gascony, France in the late 1600s, why is Valentine wear heavy eye-shadow, cheek blush, and bright lip stick? She does the best she can with the dialog she's given but ohhh, such dialog. Then, in a society that is 200 years away from Women's Suffrage, she expects... DEMANDS... to be treated equally with the men without even proving herself. She even rudely bursts into the Musketeer Commander's office and demands to speak with him. He rightly should have thrown out anyone who tried that except the King. She takes it as an insult that he is not impressed with her. She doesn't try to hide her feminine side at all including having a tailor made, curve hugging Musketeer uniform. This would have worked out better if it was more a ""Connecticut Yankee"" type where a modern woman is sent back in time but her modern sensibilities are entirely out of place in this film. I'm not sure why a great talent like Michael York agreed to appear in this travesty but I guess a paycheck is a paycheck.

The characters are superb (this was the first thing I ever saw Ewan McGregor in) and the situations genuine.

Okay you may not have come up with Michael Douglas as one of the ghosts Uncle Wayne (based on Robert Evans?), but you could probably come up with the rest. Its not bad but I couldn't believe that anyone would pay to see it. (Admittedly I wandered in from one theater to another when the movie I paid for proved to be a bust, so I can say I split the cost, but even then I feel a little cheated.) I will say in the films defense that the speech about why the wedding should go on is a great piece of writing. Its a wonderful romantic piece on why we should not run away from love, its probably the best thing in it, and one wishes that more of the film had been up to that level (a couple of other bits are almost that good but they are fleeting). The film has left me wondering about Jennifer Garner. Her role is unremarkable and she has no real presence. Yes she is adequate but there is no star quality. Is it the role? Is it her? I don't know.

"I was surprised when I checked the credits of this miniseries to see that it had not been based on a book. It feels like something based on a book, because it has such a complete and detailed mythology and a feeling of back story that is rare in the work of screenwriters.

Much of it seems unfinished, as if we are watching a ""making of"" segment on the bonus material portion of a DVD.<br /><br />IMDb lists the title as Shark Bait in the U.S. and The Reef as the U.K. title. However, the copy I rented from a U.S. Blockbuster store had the latter title.<br /><br />The film is rated G for General Audiences by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), but is riddled with crude, scatological humor (farting noises followed by bubbles rising from behind  a fish ""wetting"" himself and the surrounding water turning yellow), numerous references to butts, and even one reference to putting things in one's butt. When a movie is rated ""G"" one usually expects that it won't contain any material which could possibly be considered offensive. Not the case here.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this movie a rating of 2, and not 1, is that my kids under 6 found it mildly amusing (emphasis on mildly), but I can't even recommend it for kids of that age because of the gratuitous potty humor. Those over that age, however, were as bored and disappointed as I was.",Performance,Plot,
"I was extremely disappointed and irritated by this film. Movies should be about being transported into the lives and situations of the people on the screen but that singularly failed to happen in the case of 'Closer'.<br /><br />The characters and relationships definitely do not ring true at all. It's not a question of not liking the people depicted, though none are likable, especially not the irritating doctor character. It's not a question of finding some of the language shocking - it is no more shocking than you'd see in a TV drama and there is virtually no nudity or sex. It's just that you couldn't care less about the characters as you don't really get to know them. Each one has no feeling of reality, no subtlety and no authenticity. They do things people only do in films, not in real life.<br /><br />Do doctors really sit and engage in chat room sex talk in a hospital back office before going into the theatre to do an operation? Would photographer Anna have talked to and befriended sleazy doctor Larry in the aquarium... and then married him? Do people really hitch, split, re-hitch, bitch, bawl and spit at each other over who's been doing it with whomsoever's extramarital lover - or just ex, and is not telling the truth? Truthfulness toreal life is something this story lacks completely.<br /><br />I found the dialogue wooden, the words contrived, the performances staged. Maybe it works better as a play. If so then it has not transferred successfully to film. I found it suffocating to have so many high profile actors together.<br /><br />You know when a movie isn't working when you start to see the script roll in front of you like an autocue, and when you think you can see the crew looking on as the actors work through their lines.<br /><br />After wasting two hours and five pounds on this movie I am losing my confidence in going to the cinema, except to see something I have seen before or has been personally recommended to me.",Performance,,
"I was surprised to note that the film was released in 2004; it has a very ""1960's"" European feel in look and soundtrack. None of the supposedly US characters looks or sounds American; the hairstyles and clothes, again, are very retro and much of the dialog appears to have been looped--without the appropriate background noise! None of this would matter if the conflicts or characters were involving--but the action is very formulaic and the acting poor.It certainly is difficult to come up with new approaches to disaster-type scenarios on limited budgets, but ""China Syndrome"" and countless earthquake films have already been done. As the Bible--and Spielberg in his Oscar acceptance speech--said: ""In the beginning was the word..."" With or without a significant budget, there first needs to be decent script, and this one just doesn't work. If the creators of Mystery Theater 3000 were still doing their magic, this film would be a perfect candidate for parody.",Performance,Plot,
"This is a cult movie alright, although I'm pretty alone being a cultist here, this movie has all the elements of an ugly movie of the 70s (though i hear its huge in Australia).<br /><br />First of, trying to learn about Ned Kelly from watching this movie is just impossible, the story trail is as lose as the one in Dune and it jumps so fast from scene to scene that is unbelievable. In one scene a police officer swears not to tell the authorities that the he had an accident with the Kellys in which he was wounded, he was pretty happy and swearers not to tell, 1 second into the next scene Ma Kelly is standing for trial. What??, so he told them?, he what??. No one knows.<br /><br />the movie does those jump cuts a lot. and not only that, but you get to see some really weird scenes on the movie (such in the ending when both Kelly's brothers kill themselves in a rather artistic way). It all in the end gets explained if we consider that probably the entire cast and crew was on drugs, and not only them, but the caterers and the cleaning guys also.<br /><br />But that of course is not the main strenght of the movie, the main thing that this movie's got going-on is of course the horrible performance of Mick Jagger, who doesn't really act whatsoever if we consider it, but rather just stands around being the lead singer of the Rolling Stones than Ned Kelly.<br /><br />We get to see Mick: -as a drinker. -as a singer. -as a ladies man. -as a street fighting man.<br /><br />so we pretty much just see him being him, not one line is delivered correctly, but always as if Kelly was really angry because he ordered a latte and not a cappuccino or with a huge hangover from partying all night.<br /><br />The movie ends with Ned on his armor getting shot by the Brits, which is one of the memorable scenes of the movie, mainly because it actually seems to had been taken from a serious movie instead of a generic 70s movie.<br /><br />See this movie, its the funky version of Ned Kelly, but of course as all of them are Brits you just get to see a white cast. Kinda like the Stones music if we think about it.",Performance,,
"7.2 on IMDb? Really? It must be a reaction of Middle America to the recent atheist uprising (books by Hitchens, Dawkins, etc.) that there are so many fantastical movies lately. Not satisfied with comic book heroes (Batman, Iron Man, Spiderman, etc.), or flat-out fantasy (Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc.), Hollywood has turned to outright religious propaganda (Knowing, Henry Poole Was Here, Taking Chance etc.). I enjoy watching movies as often as possible, so this trend was readily apparent to me. Unfortunately, it doesn't make for a quality movie experience.<br /><br />I can only imagine the pitch the writer made to the studios: ""It's like Saw/Seven mixed with the Davinci Code!"". Except with even worse writing: <br /><br />Quaid: ""He made 4 rigs. We got 2 victims"".<br /><br />Detective who looks like Chuck Berry crossed with Willem Dafoe: ""Ah, sh*t, so there's 2 more"".<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes, watch out! That's some fine detective work. How about this: <br /><br />Quaid to Zhang Ziyi: ""Well, I should also tell you that...I'm not very good with children."" <br /><br />Ziyi (who is 30 years old and looks at least 25): ""I'm not a child."" <br /><br />You don't say! This is only a sweet taste of the delicious dialogue you can expect from...THE HORSEMEN! Further, the foreshadowing is so heavy you can barely see. I don't want to spoil the grand experience of enjoying this cinema for anyone, but from the opening scenes of Quaid dealing with his emo sons (the older one is admittedly not bad in this movie), well...it ain't no Sixth Sense, let's put it that way. <br /><br />Not really sure who this is supposed to appeal to: either parents of Columbine-type nutjobs who can be reassured that their poor parenting skills are understandable because they're explained IN THE BIBLE or misunderstood youth who feel neglected by Mommy and Daddy, so it's okay if they act out a Marilyn Manson video. Regardless, it's the viewer who pays the price.<br /><br />The only revelation this movie provides is this: Hollywood has your money and time yet again!",Plot,,
"Although this film was intended to be a modern-day and comedic version of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, IMHO, Guess Who played much more like an episode of ""The Proud Family"" cartoon. Bernie Mac's character, Percy Jones, seemed especially like the over-protective, nobody's-going-to-date-my-daughter cartoon father that Penny Proud contends with every Saturday morning on ABC.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Guess Who barely touched on the racial issues. The jokes about racial difference were old and predictable. The funniest portrayal of the racial difference was the music playing while the father and the fiancée were riding together in a car. And in true sit-com fashion, all the issues are ironed out for a nice happy comedy ending.<br /><br />If you don't mind paying a few dollars for a matinée show, it's not a bad way to spend a couple hours entertaining the children. Otherwise, I'd say skip it.",Performance,Plot,

"Before I saw this film I read all the reviews on this site. And then I saw the movie...and I was wondering what all those other reviewers had been taking... The film lasts about 85 minutes, and that's too long by half. I always hated Chevalier's awful accent (half the time you're straining to try and make sense of what he's saying), but as a rule his lighthearted acting makes it bearable. Not here. Hopkins as the princess and Barbier as the king are worse than caricatures and there are some very xenophobic remarks here and there. But the worst is...Claudette's performance. I love, no I adore Claudette Colbert. She's by far my favourite actress of the first half of the 20th century (Michelle Pfeiffer took her crown in the latter part). But what she's showing us here, is shameful. She's overacting as if she's in a (talking) movie for the first time. For example when she's leaving Chevalier's apartment, and she's leaving the key. Her facial expressions are way too pathetic and remind me of the silent movies, when everything had to be over the top to convey the meaning. This is a movie to see once, then quickly forget about. 2 stars out of 10.",Performance,,
"After seeing THE SOUTHERNER for the first time, I had a number of reactions:<br /><br />(1) The title was a desperate marketing ploy by United Artists to find an audience for a film that must have been a severe marketing challenge. The film (and the novel, HOLD AUTUMN IN YOUR HAND, by George Sessions Perry, on which the movie was based) actually is set in Texas, which is not the same place as Alabama or North Carolina; but ""THE SOUTHERNER"" has a chauvinistic appeal that must have attracted some regional viewers.<br /><br />(2) I recalled a critic's remark about a later legendary film (in an entirely different way), HEAVEN'S GATE -- to paraphrase: In Hollywood, the poor are more virtuous than the rich because they're more photogenic.<br /><br />(3) The conclusion of the film is quite as artificial as the tacked-on ending of John Ford's THE GRAPES OF WRATH (1941), but without Ma Joad's conviction. Where is Jane Darwell when you need her?<br /><br />(4) A couple of Hispanics (Texas, right?) but not a single African-American in this South? Somewhere, Jesse Helms is smiling.<br /><br />THE SOUTHERNER was widely praised when it came out in 1945 (and continues to earn admirers) because it was so different from Hollywood's traditional portrayal of ""the South"" and played on the liberal, proletarian sympathies of certain audiences and critics. Hollywood had tried to address the plight of Southern cotton croppers before (Michael Curtiz's CABIN IN THE COTTON, 1932, and Ford's TOBACCO ROAD, 1941) but THE SOUTHERNER does so without drowning in CABIN'S sociological balance or Ford's forced humor. The earnestness of the film is a large part of its appeal.<br /><br />The reputation of Jean Renoir also is responsible for the high marks this film receives. Renoir had made a ""southern"" film earlier -- SWAMP WATER, in 1941 -- and perhaps he found the region interesting. No doubt he found the human drama of the Tucker family a fitting subject, but the results don't show any special insight to time and place. (Renoir apparently rewrote Hugo Butler's original script, from Perry's novel, and two Southern-born writers, William Faulkner and Nunnally Johnson, apparently had some input into the screenplay as well.) My biggest problem with the film is simply that the people are too pretty and the story too pat. I don't know that Joel McCrea or any Hollywood leading man of that era would have been more appropriate than Zachary Scott in the role of Sam Tucker, but Scott and the entire cast are just not convincing. One can't get over the impression that these are well-meaning actors rather than real people. J. Carrol Naish, usually a very convincing actor, comes closest to nailing his character, but playing the S.O.B. is usually easier than portraying the S.O.E. (Salt Of the Earth). Beulah Bondi and Norman Lloyd are wasted caricatures.<br /><br />In the end, THE SOUTHERNER fails to convince because the filmmakers failed to deal with the real dilemma of the family whose cotton crop has been destroyed by a flood. I wanted to know how these people were going to survive the loss of a year's hard work. These people are in real trouble! Instead, we get an inspirational ""keep on keepin' on"" message that mutes the tragedy of this family's loss. It's rather insulting, really, to both the audience and to the real croppers who had to deal with such a precarious existence, year in and year out.<br /><br />I don't know that there's ever been a film that's effectively dealt with this aspect of American life and culture, but if you really want to know about the people that THE SOUTHERNER purports to portray, make the time to read James Agee's classic rumination, LET US NOW PRAISE FAMOUS MEN, which includes the moving photographs by Walker Evans.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: June 19, 2009: I've recently read HOLD AUTUMN IN YOUR HAND, on which THE SOUTHERNER is based, and the book only reinforces my view that the film is Hollywood proletarian schmaltz -- well-meaning, but a slick and sanitized portrayal of this culture. The book itself ends a bit abruptly, with a ""happy"" ending that's only a little less contrived than the film's. If you are interested in this aspect of American culture, however, it's a decent and quick read; and there's a better movie to be made from HOLD AUTUMN IN YOUR HAND.",Plot,,
"I was born white in 1963 in a WASP neighborhood in Indiana. But I remembered this show when they came out recently with the new ""Nurse"" shows--Nurse Jackie and HawthoRNe. I looked it up b/c I couldn't remember the star's name and I was telling a friend about it at work. But I remembered this show that I watched when I was all of 5 years old. Because it mattered. And even then, it pulled me toward where I am now. I have been an RN since 1984, and now work as a nurse practitioner. I am proud to be a nurse. I cried when Obama won the election, because I felt like it was a win for MY side. A huge win--and this show was part of that, the beginnings. I am proud that I have been a part of the ""I'd like to teach the world to sing..."" generations. That what we have all worked toward is the equality, not just of black and white but of everyone. That we all have value that deserves to be heard and witnessed equally. And I think the fact that this rather brave for the time show (and actress) was able to influence the 5 year old white child of an Alabama bigot to spend a lifetime in the same line of service to others says a hell of a lot about its ""epochal"" effects on the minds and people of that time. Even today, I think I'd rather be ""Julia"" than ""Jackie"". I would feel more respectable. Thank you Ms Carroll and company. You made a difference. I hope today's shows can stand up to the same test. We need nurses, and we need people who cross the lines.",Plot,Others,

The soundtrack is amazing, one of the best I've heard on a film so far, the script leaves a lot of room for improvement for my taste, but its somewhat compensated by the artistic risks taken by the director to highlight racial differences, conflict and equality. My only criticism is Ximena's Sariñana's acting (Renata's sister), who is a fabulous singer (proven by the soundtrack), but unfortunately a poor actress. Hats off to the character Ulises and the actor who plays him, since I think his performance was absolutely real, believable, sincere and just superb.",Plot,Performance,Music
"This movie really is, as some of the commentators have said, a tour de force of mise en scene - it is shot with a distinctive hand-held camera style, features some powerful performances (most notably by Ian Gamazon as Adam, a secular Muslim American born in the Phillipines), and makes exceptional use of its gritty noir setting of Philippino urban slums. <br /><br />Yet, the movie is ultimately extremely disappointing. Cavite ultimately fails in two interconnected ways. First, as a dramatic story, chiefly because its main character is irredeemably weak (and the vicious, stereotyped anti-gay viewpoint portrayed tacitly builds strength on this weakness). Adam not only fails as a protagonist - he is unable to affect the action in any way throughout the entire film - but as a moral being. He shirks responsibility for his stark moral choices: Ultimately, he is willing to take decisive action to murder a large crowd of innocent people to save his own loved ones - and this miserable character is the only potentially oppositional voice that might at least rhetorically counter the unseen but omniscient and omnipotent ""Abu Sayaf"" spokesman. As a result, that terrorist mastermind directs every aspect of the film, and the erstwhile protagonist is utterly impotent and, indeed, evil.<br /><br />If Adam fails completely to present an alternative or corrective to the (alleged) Abu Sayaf propaganda, the cinematography seems equally complicit in its support for the terrorist's vague and self-satisfied critique of western society (with its documentary footage of privation and social exclusion). So, the deck is stacked from deuce to ace, and that is why the film so completely fails as a work of drama. <br /><br />But, secondly, this is also why the film fails morally as well. Cavite goes beyond consciousness raising in its vivid presentation of poverty and moves toward a subtle, but deeply corrupt sympathy for ""revolutionary"" terrorism in the name of ""the people"". The kindest reading is that, with no effective counterweight to the faceless voice of the Abu Sayaf terrorist, the film falls victim to a sort of Stockholm Syndrome, crossing over completely into the terrorist's view of the world. In fact, at the end, the film really lays its cards on the table in a terrible, facile scene back in the USA, where Adam is shown to be victim of blatant American prejudice because of his religion.<br /><br />Despite its technical achievements, this is an evil movie. It is wrong and it is destructive. By failing to offer an effective alternative to mass murder in the name of social revolution, this movie leaves us with nothing beyond the vague but malicious terrorist viewpoint, without any dramatic or rhetorical attempt at rebuttal. The result is not only bad storytelling, but the nasty suspicion that one has watched an extremely well-shot propaganda video for an hour and twenty minutes. <br /><br />Jeremiah B.C.

"(Includes a background of characters that reveals who they are, If you want to keep all that a surprise, don't read this review.)<br /><br />This movie is a movie that you feel okay with watching every once and awhile. It is one of my favorite Disney Channel Original Movies because it has a plot that you can follow. It also has a lot of people in the movie, making it a movie that all people can relate to because there is lots of different types of people as well. I liked it also because even though the family cast may not be the best of actors and actresses, they put together a family type of feeling that makes it seem like they are a family, even though they are not. The ideas that the movie used were pretty clever as well. The movie centers on a phantom terrorizing a big 26-screen movie theater. This is mainly a mystery as to who has been doing all of the unwanted actions in the theater.<br /><br />To give you a background and summary of the characters I'll tell you about the family in the movie. The main character is Pete Riley, played by Taylor Handley. He is the assistant manager of this big megaplex, which means he has a lot of responsibility and duties to bring about before his shift is over. He has two siblings in the movie, his younger sister, Karen, played by Caitlin Wachs, and his younger brother, Bryan, played by Jacob Smith. They are the typical type of a younger brother and sister that nag you and annoy you mainly because they are bored. Pete is the type of older brother that in a way, tolerates it. They have a mother as well, who is probably just your everyday mother that has her sternness and fun side. <br /><br />I think that Mickey Rooney, playing Movie Mason, did the best acting job. There were really no let-downs in this movie, but being a Disney Channel Original movie, it could have been better, only by adding more character development. This is a movie mainly for kids 6-11 or so. Teens may also enjoy it, only the teens today are mostly into PG-13 movies, not necessarily G movies. I enjoyed the movie because of the slight comedy, mystery, and some suspense. All in all it is worth it to see. Children will most definitely like it, maybe adults too. It's a good family movie that I give an 8.5/10.",Performance,Plot,
"Compared to the lame horror films that the major studios theatrically release these days, THE WOODS is superior and stands out. It easily deserves a wide theatrical but remains on the shelf for no logical reason. The film is a variation on a SUSPIRIA-type witch story and delivers genuine scares; not the trendy, superficial jarring jumps 'boos' that the reviewer above probably expects. Director McKee (MAY, SICK GIRL) delivers a deliberate pace and gradually building mood and atmosphere. Above all else, THE WOODS is character-driven with real acting!

"I had the great joy of watching David Lean's MADELEINE(1950)for the first time ever on TCM early this morning, and can say without any reservations that though it is one of the great director's lesser-known works, but it is by no means lesser in either acting or direction.<br /><br />Featuring the glacial blonde Ann Todd(then Mrs. David Lean) as the real-life accused murderess Madeleine Smith, the film skillfully portrays the travail a foolish and willful young woman goes through when she follows her heart instead of her head and gets ensnared in a sticky situation. Caught between her tyrannical martinet father, James Smith, played excellently by the great Leslie Banks with his paralysed profile which added an extra flourish to his cold unsympathetic manner and her charming but unscrupulous gold-digging French paramour, Emile L'Anglier played skillfully by Ivan Desny, Ann Todd's Madeleine is veritably ""caught between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea!"" It would seem that there is but one recourse for Madeleine, that of shutting two-bit Casanova and lothario L'Anglier up so that her fire-breathing dragon of a father does not bite her pretty little head off, in much the same way that I have enjoyed biting into pastry Madeleines! But the ambiguity throughout the film of whether Madeleine actually did the deed and put paid to her paramour is maintained even up to the end when Madeleine gives her leprous Madonna half-smile which could indicate either guilt or innocence, leaving it up for the viewing audience to decide on their own.<br /><br />The splendid direction of Lean, the superb moody photography of Guy Green contrasting various shades of darkness and light as well as interesting character studies of familiar character actors' and actresses' faces, the excellent film editing of Clive Donner(later to become a great director as well) and Geoffrey Foot, the authentic costume design of Margaret Furse all add to the moving drama. Jewel-like performances by such thespians as Barbara Everest as Madeleine's mother, Jean Cadell as Mrs. Jenkins the careworn landlady, Kynaston Reeves as a lugubrious Dr. Penny, Amy Veness as the sympathetic police matron Miss Aiken, John Laurie as the hypocritical Bible-spouting religious maniac and fanatic Divine rabble-rouser exhorting the crowd to condemn Madeleine, Edward Chapman as the worried Dr. Thompson, Moyra Fraser(more than HALF A CENTURY later, 55 years to be exact, in Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer's ""As Time Goes By"" latest 2005 episode as one of the regulars, bumptious Penny, a role since 1993) as a spirited Highland dancer! Irene Browne as Mrs. Grant, George Benson as the Chemist, Eva Bartok as the Girl, Ivor Barnard as Mr. Murdoch, Anthony Newley! as Chemist's Assistant, Wylie Watson as Huggins, and many, many more, bear in mind that from Jean Cadell onwards, these were all UNCREDITED roles in Lean's film! They join with the credited cast Barbara Everest, Leslie Banks, Ivan Desny, Ann Todd, Norman Wooland as the ever-stolid and respectable William Minnoch, Madeleine's would-be-husband-to-be, Elizabeth Sellars as the harried but loyal pretty housemaid, Patricia Raine and Susan Stranks as Bessie and Janet Smith, Madeleine's younger siblings, Eugene Deckers as Thuau the unsympathetic French consul and friend of L'Anglier, and Barry Jones as the merciless Prosecuting Counsel. Last but not least is Hammer films stalwart and a superb actor, the late Andre Morell(husband of the late Joan Greenwood) as the Defending Counsel, who gives an impassioned and heart-wrenching yet cool and logical defense of Madeleine that has got to be one of the greatest courtroom speeches in Cinematic history! At least I think it is! The next time I bite into a pastry Madeleine I will recall Andre Morell's defense! <br /><br />All in all, a FIVE STAR ***** film rating for the actors' performances alone!",Directional Techniques,Performance,Plot
"At least Attack of the Clones is watchable. Actually, I have seen it a few times since the theater and it does get quite better. However, when you decide to watch it up against the original you realize it is still a weak movie.<br /><br />10 years have passed since Phantom Menace. Which is part of the problem, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN EPISODE 1! You could have had Anakin meet Padme at this age and the love story would have been much more realistic. Them meeting and falling in love could be episode one and the clone wars (more about them) could be two and the turn to the darkside could have been three. However, I digress. It starts off with an assassination attempt and Anakin meeting Padme. It is kind of creepy that they meet when Anakin was a child and he had a little crush on her and it has turned into this full born obsession.<br /><br />There is another attempt on her life and a very cool (probably best action sequence of this movie) chase through the city. Rather than give away the rest of the plot, I will focus on the problems and good points of the movie.<br /><br />Firstly, it is a much better movie than Menace. The pacing is better and the characters, while still a bit stiff, more relatable. We even get a glimpse into Darth Vader when Anakin slaughters Tuskan Raiders after they are responsible for the death of his mother. The lightsaber battle with Yoda at the end, while laughable, is quite entertaining.<br /><br />The problems with clones are similar (just not as bad) as with Menace. The major being the script. I personally like the idea of forbidden love, even in star wars movie, but the lines used in it ""e.g. the kiss i should have never given you,"" ""i can't breath"" are so cheese it makes you want to gag. The actors are not bad, the writing is.<br /><br />Hayden Christensen is a good Anakin Skywalker, the problem was Lucas decided to make Anakin a whiny teenager rather than a young Jedi with demons (e.g. anger) he can not control. Christensen wanted to make the character darker, but Lucas stuck with Anakin being a whiny teenager.<br /><br />Overally, this is an average to below average movie that I would have not watched more than once if it were not Star Wars.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques

OK, if it's 70 below why are these guys hanging around OUTSIDE the plane, shivering while wrapped in one thin blanket, with a fire consisting of two tiny sticks that wouldn't warm an insect. If I was out there at 70 below (which is ridiculous in the first place), I would have a forest fire going.<br /><br />This movie is so overly dramatic it is just not believable on any level.

"Long lost in a prolonged rights battle and unseen for years, Dario Argento's Four Flies On Grey Velvet may come from his most consistently inspired period but it's still such thin and often tedious stuff you'd half suspect he was keeping it hidden himself out of embarrassment until you realise that he's happy enough for the far worse Phantom of the Opera and The Card Player to still be out there.<br /><br />The chief problem is the disjointed and unconvincing plotting, but Michael Brandon's insipid performance as the passive unlikeable and uninterestingly passive musician being blackmailed after accidentally killing someone shows up just how rickety this one is without a charismatic or proactive figure to hold it together. It's not without its compensations and a couple of striking pieces of imagery  a recurring sequence of a Saudi execution and an ultra-slow motion car crash  although Argento seems to be expending far more energy and visual flair into purely expositionary shots like letters being delivered or phone calls being made than the surprisingly few setpieces. Too often he relies on cheap gimmickry, be it Jean-Pierre Marielle's gay private eye who has never solved a case or the old 'image caught on dead person's retina' plot device, while the main character treads water. The less said about the clumsy comedy (much of which comes from brutally beating an Arab postman), the better.<br /><br />There's an appealing performance from Francine Racette that partially offsets Mimsy Farmer's hysterical overacting and a cameo from Bud Spencer that briefly threatens to liven things up but it's far more forgettable than it has any right to be in that unwelcome I-think-I'm-dropping-off-to-sleep kind of way.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
"""Marmalade Wine"" a two person teleplay introduces us to a weary hiker caught in a rainstorm and a friendly country doctor who offers the young man refuge in the storm, only to have a truly grisly ulterior motive. The sets are really threadbare, (Not sure if that was the intention or not) but the acting is good. The doctor is very creepy and really adds to the suspense here. The ending is a stomach churning revelation which is great. When you put yourself in theyoung man's shoes, you almost feel faint. <br /><br />If you've seen the Twilight Zone episode entitled ""The Howling Man"" you'll see a few similarities. A man who with an evil secret figure in both stories. A fun and shocking episode.",Performance,Plot,
"The original ""Out Of Towners"" (not the silly remake with Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin) is a underated comedy. Jack Lemmon is brilliant as the stressed Ohio businessman. I don't think any other actor could have reacted or acted as well as Lemmon does. He complains and gripes through the entire movie, yes, but he does it with intensity and not ""over the top"" histrionics. His complaining and reacting to misfortune is what carries the movie. The alternative would have been not reacting to the changes in plan and just giving up. This couple from Ohio keep trudging along. Most actors would have tried too hard to show the audience how ""angry"" they were. Lemmon's character takes down names, mutters to himself, and alternates between exasperated expressions and resignation that I found very amusing. I thought they could have found a more attractive actress to play his wife, than Sandy Dennis, but she does play the role well. She does not over react to Lemmon's verbal barrages. They become a likeable pair, and you root for them. Had they become overly aggressive or nasty, they would have lost the comedic touch they maintained. They remained charming with a comedic flair as they traipsed through the streets and subways of New York. It was a great performance by a great actor, Jack Lemmon.",Performance,,

I thought the acting sucked and the plot was cheesy. This is a total low budget B film. I cant believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I wish I could get a refund back from Blockbuster.

In this fashion, 'Matando Cabos' results in an entertaining and hilarious urban adventure.<br /><br />For all of those who are just sick of all those Latin American movies that just try to ""portray"" the reality of society with stories around prostitution, corruption, crime and injustice, you ought to see this movie. It's a good way to see that in Latin America they also ""just want to have fun"".",Directional Techniques,,
"A curious, little-seen oddity based on an Alexander Dumas tale, it adapts the story of Cagliostro, played by Orson Welles, an 18th century magician and charlatan who has strange hypnotic powers and becomes involved in a plot to overthrow the French monarchy in order to revenge himself on the aristocrat who was responsible for the execution of his parents.<br /><br />In black and white, it makes use of dark scenes, shadows, close ups and other film noir techniques to accentuate the pseudo-magical qualities of Orson Welles' character. Akim Tamiroff as Welles' gypsy friend is rather good, but Nancy Guild in the dual role of Marie Antoinette and Lorenza, the woman who Cagliostro first rescues, then manipulates, is not outstanding. There is some sword-play and many elaborate costumes are on display in the court episodes, and the early scenes showing Cagliosto's gypsy boyhood when he falls foul of the aristocrat who hangs his father and mother and sentences the boy to be whipped and blinded are strong stuff for the time.<br /><br />The film seems to have been made in Rome for United Artists and although the plot is somewhat bizarre it is strangely watchable.",Performance,Directional Techniques,Plot

It is so sad (I mean as in pathetic) - death loses its sting after an episode of this, and it is so awfully predictable and unfunny that you feel insulted. This is really just drivelly nonsense for the 5 - 8 year old kids - there is real talent in other places. Expect nothing from Spongebob Squarepants - it is so awful that you may want to cap yourself in the head. ""Over-rated"" is the only word that describes this faeces - underwater fun for kids is much better done in Finding Nemo, and this is really just an example of the sort of cr*p Nickelodeon airs.

Steer clear of Spongebob completely - unless you are a small kid who has not come to realise the true brains in the TV industry.<br /><br />The Americans may make better feature films than us Brits, but we do better comedy - the case being further proved by this (as well as the whole Nickelodeon channel) - the worst cartoon of the past decade. 1/10",Performance,,
"OK, here's how the movie works.<br /><br />There is the barest germ of an interesting detective story plot here to drive the movie: thieves use a kidnapping at the San Francisco Airport to serve as a distraction from their attempts to smuggle stuff into Mexico. Watching Pernell Roberts (the airport administrator), Clu Gulager (the airport security chief) and Van Johnson (a newspaper columnist who happens to be in the airport at the time) try to assemble the clues, figure out what's happening, and scramble to thwart the bad guys before the bad guys can 'get away with it'...is mildly diverting in the same way that the 'caper plots' from ""Hawaii Five-O"" used to be.<br /><br />But because this series pilot is supposed to be setting us up for a series similar to ""The Grand Hotel"", and not just a detective series, the filmmakers have to flesh things out with human interest and character tags. So we get Pernell's battle with the senators over modernizing the airport. We get a divorce subplot between Van Johnson and his wife which in turn generates an ABC after school special segment with son Davey, who is so upset by his parents' impending separation that he...um....gets into an unguarded plane on the tarmac and takes off. (What?????). And we also get a public service announcement subplot in which it is revealed that businessmen tend to be stuffy and prejudiced, while guitar playing hippies and airport security chiefs can relate to each other. Or something.<br /><br />The results are, well....watchable. All the actors here are competent in a made-for-TV way. Pernell Roberts' character is incredibly smug and self-important, but I think that was a deliberate choice by the director and the screenwriter - don't forget that ""McGarrett"", the hero of ""Hawaii Five-O"" (a very successful hit in the same era) was also arrogant and hard-nosed, and I think the writers were hoping to mimic that series success with a similar protagonist.<br /><br />But it's obvious that the makers of ""SFI"" spectacularly misjudged the drawing power of the airport setting in generating viewer interest, especially when they made the airport and everything in it muddy orange and brown. And the screenplay is pretty much stuck in 2nd gear for the duration of the film. You've never seen so much screen time devoted to actors giving each other meaningful glances in your life.<br /><br />Anyway, no one bought it, and the pilot sunk without a trace, to be revived by ""Mystery Science Theater"" over 30 years later. The MST coverage is mildly amusing (as always) and helps you pass the time until the pilot winds to its inevitable close and everyone lives happily ever after.",Performance,Directional Techniques,Plot
"Curious how so many people view this movie in the narrowest of terms, e.g. as an study/attack on ""male aggression"", as a comment on the personalities/politics of Serbs, & similar self-serving ideologic simplifications. I see this as a basic & pure allegory on the human condition. It could be Ireland or Zambia or a dozen other places, past, present & future. People love to kill people (& every other available living thing as well - see the article in the NY Times today about the devastation of gorilla & elephant populations in the former Congo). Serbians are better than most at depicting this because they're that much closer to the event. But none of us is terribly far from the ultimate human condition. We just pretend to be more civilized.

I can understand the makers were trying to be funny but it was as funny as dying of dysentery in a muddy trench. Also were the black & white cut scenes really necessary. Yes war really did happen. In fact they were probably more interesting than the rest of the film. For the few good actors it starred it could have been a great film but alas the script was weak.

What didn't work for me was some of the editing/pacing. There were one or two scenes that dragged bit - the first guy that was killed in the forest plus why didn't he say anything? The other scene I wasn't crazy about was the guy wandering around aimlessly with clippers - what was the point of that? Wasn't all that crazy about the performances of Peter's friends. Here is what does work and quite well. The photography in the movie is exquisite. The color red really jumps out at you. The sound track is to die for, especially since it is an original score. I've read other reviews on here where people say this is some of the best art work they've seen. They are absolutely right. There are some very powerful performances here. Three come to mind. The woman who plays the teacher, Liz Callahan is an absolute pro. The guy who plays Peter, David Morwick is also great. He's got the natural stuff. Erin Merryweather played by Vigdise Anholt is one scary villain. She nails it. Knowing that this was low budget and not done by a studio, it blew me away watching it in the theater. This belongs on the big screen. Also, I've heard the ride to finish this film was a tough one particularly for the filmmakers so they have my respect for seeing it through.

"Ever since I first saw the Drew Carey roast that kicked off the tradition of airing the Friar's Club Roasts on television, I knew that no matter who was being roasted, the comedians could make it funny. And why not? They were people in a club dedicated to comedy. These were people who were legends like Freddie Roman and Alan King.<br /><br />I carried this opinion until the Roast of Denis Leary aired, a roast which was not an official Friar's Club Roast and was actually produced by Denis Leary himself. It was a sick case of ego boosting, but even it had a few good laughs. However, with the Roast of Jeff Foxworthy, consider the horse flogged dead.<br /><br />When we once were treated with comedic performances by some of the world's best comics, we've been downgraded to three people from Tough Crowd (a show so horrifically unfunny that not even spillover from The Daily Show could save it), the same Gilbert Gottfried plays an animal bit from Leary's roast and the same other three guys from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. And, a hilarious video (note the sarcasm) of Denis Leary half-assedly calling the guests gay. Ground breaking stuff.<br /><br />Though, it wasn't a total bust. Greg Giraldo did have some funny jokes and the Bush impersonator was pretty dead on. Unfortunately for the rest of the show, it came off as an obvious attempt at making a quick buck off a passing fad. Not to say that Jeff Foxworthy doesn't deserve the recognition of a roast because he does. It's too bad that this was so superficial that it's not really an honor.<br /><br />A pale husk of what roasts formerly were, I just hope for the day when the Friar's Club and Comedy Central make up and let them do the roasts again instead of Denis Leary's company.",Performance,,

"Part of the joy of sitting down to watch a Francis Veber comedy is that you know that you're about to experience something smart and refreshing to this stultified genre. Veber, after all, is a veritable master of the screwball and romantic comedy, having birthed such modern gems as the original BIRD CAGE, THE TOY, THE DINNER GAME, and THE CLOSET (amongst many others that were sometimes even able to make the transition to American adaptation).<br /><br />Surprisingly, THE VALET is no such masterwork. What makes this such a surprising development is that THE CLOSET came out only a few years ago, and it can be considered one of Veber's most clever works to date. So why did he go from clever to crap? Who knows.<br /><br />The real trouble with THE VALET is that it lacks ALL of Veber's classic conventions -- his smarts, his ability to construct realistic characters dealing with absurd situations, and his canny ability to use wordplay in a manner rare to current screwball/romantic comedies (in France, America, or anywhere else). He's also FANTASTIC at comedic development, in really building up the various circumstances that snowball into a torrential storm of humor.<br /><br />THE VALET, however, played as yet another string in the long ball of yarn that is the rapidly dwindling comedy genre. It felt, well... American. I really was waiting for Julia Roberts or Richard Gere to pop in, or perhaps Rob Schneider would make a clumsy entry, tip his hat, and vacate immediately.<br /><br />The story was dull at best, the characters were entirely unrealistic, and there was nothing clever about the execution of the paper-thin plot. The worst part of all is that the dynamics of the characters and story never worked or felt truthful. Everything was completely ham-fisted and forced; where was the grace we see in Veber's previous entries? Without giving too much away, let's just say that many a time, you're wondering: ""Gee, why would ANYBODY like that annoying, obnoxious, selfish pig of an executive, especially his own rather good-looking wife and a supermodel... who, of course, has an indefatigable heart of gold?"" It just didn't make sense, and there were many moments throughout in which you ask yourself similar questions (eg, ""Why would he be so obsessed with this mean, callous young woman who obviously cares little about him?"").<br /><br />By the end of the movie, everyone is pretty much on the same side, as they try to battle it out with the Donald Trump-esquire antagonist character. You pretty much know where it's going all along, and the ending comes quite abruptly with little resolution outside of, ""And that's the end of THAT chapter."" Oh, well.

Uncle Silas (perfectly played by Derrick De Marney) and his accomplices; a French governess, Madame de la Rougierre (marvelously played by Katina Paxinou), and his son, Dudley (well played by Manning Whiley) are planning to do away with the heroine to gain her fortune. Thankfully, there are intervals where the young woman visits with her sympathetic cousin Monica (nicely played by Sophie Stewart).

"Not the most shocking, nor the most bloody, nor the most stylish of giallo, but it's likable enough and is just that little bit different. Much helped by a very decent performance from Corrado Pani as the cigar chomping guy who seeks to unravel one of the most complicated of tales. Far too many characters and just a few too many red herrings and yet it does keep going and if Paola Tedesco as the female lead does not match the performance of Pani, this may be the fault of the dubbers. Not awash with killings, what there are, are very good.

In fact I think that for 1954 ""Prince Valiant"" takes the most of Foster's novels about knights and vikings in the times of legendary King Arthur.<br /><br />Good colorful locations, fine settings, good action scenes and a sort of ""sticky"" musical score that even sounds appropriate help the picture along with an acceptable script and Henry Hathaway's prolix direction.<br /><br />Highlights o the movie are James Mason's convincing villain, Brian Aherne's fine portrayal of King Arthur and a violent and smashing final duel between Valiant and the unmasked Black Knight.<br /><br />If you like medieval costume adventures you'll enjoy this one too.",Plot,,

"Bone chilling terrors with a hint of the fantastic await audiences who dare to enter The Orphanage. Produced by Guillermo Del Toro, The Orphanage continues the tradition the filmmaker started with films like The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, by showing the darker sides of humanity through frightening fantasies. In many ways Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona has applied Del Toro's own winning formula to The Orphanage and has made the most flawless film of this lineage.<br /><br />Moving back to the orphanage where she grew up, Laura and her husband Carlos plan to reopen the property as a home for mentally handicapped children. The gorgeous old house seems too good to be true, and it is. Her son Simon starts telling his parents of an ""imaginary"" friend, Tomas. Ignoring Simon's claims as merely childhood banter, the parents continue in their work, readying the house. Supernatural disturbances and a maniacal old woman start to disturb the family, resulting in the sudden and traumatic disappearance of Simon. Desperate and panicked, both Laura and Carlos must look within themselves, and confront the beings that haunt the orphanage, if they are ever to see their son again.<br /><br />A commentary on faith and love, Bayona uses the thrills and troubling chills of The Orphanage to create a powerful message. Using the disappearance of Simon as the catalyst for showing the devotion of a mother's love, Laura plays a stark contrast to her husband's practical interpretation of their harrowing situation. While Carlos would rather believe that there is a logical answer to unlocking this mystery, Laura explores more otherworldly options.<br /><br />Her knowledge of the orphanage and the solitary pain that her missing child must be going through makes her a prime vessel to confront the ghastly creatures from beyond, and answer the dark questions that De Toro and Bayona dare to ask. Like last year's Oscar front runner, Pan's Labyrinth, Bayona mixes a bit of the fantastical into The Orphanage. Allusions to legendary fables, such as the overt Peter Pan reference, combined with the staple fantasy images, help The Orphanage rise above the average horror romp.<br /><br />With only the faintest bit of gore, The Orphanage accomplishes its scares methodically, using the somber atmosphere to give audiences goosebumps. The creaky old mansion appears far more menacing at night, and Bayona makes use of incredible sound mixing to keep viewers on edge as the protagonist explores the dark unknown.<br /><br />Pairing the producer's innate knowledge of the cinematic language of horror with the raw and untested talents of a first time director paid off brilliantly. There is a sense of restraint when it comes to the scares in The Orphanage that many veteran filmmakers have failed to approach. Bayona lets the frights build subconsciously, making each one far more effective when unleashed. In fact, few cinematic moments rival The Orphanage for sheer terror as when Laura turns to a group of ghost hunters to help solve their specter problem.<br /><br />Helping to increase the tense atmosphere is stellar production design and gorgeous cinematography. While there may be no fauns or pale men lurking in The Orphanage, the design of Tomas alone is sure to give off its fair share of shivers. Belen Rueda is equally stunning in her performance as Laura. The actress lends credibility to the phantasmagorical happenings, capturing our sympathy as a fully rounded character. We follow her as a mother and a victim, and we can only pray that her faith will reunite her with Simon.<br /><br />Heading to American shores nearly one year after the stunning domestic success of Pan's Labyrinth, The Orphanage should appeal to an equally wide audience. While longtime, art house, Del Toro fiends will certainly be please with the dramatic arc of the picture, the strong horror element and shocking ending should make the film easily translatable for all viewers, despite the language barrier. One thing is for sure, with The Orphanage we have adopted another truly talented Spanish filmmaker, and Juan Antonio Bayona is a director to watch.<br /><br />-Joe Russo",Plot,Directional Techniques,

"""Décalage Horaire"" or ""Jet Lag"" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2002.<br /><br /> Danielle Thompson's ""Decalage Horaire"" is a simple, yet not necessarily simplistic, ode to love. The story concerns two opposites who meet at Charles de Gaulle Airport during a strike. They are constantly thrown together by fate ending up spending a night together (sex does not enter the equation) and during the course of their wait realising they have more in common than they thought.<br /><br /> Félix (Jean Reno) is a French man living in the US. He is chasing after a woman he belives he still loves. Rose (Juliette Binoche) is a Beautician who has a one-way ticket to Mexico, she is desperately running away from a man she no longer loves.<br /><br /> As Félix, Reno gives a sullen performance as a man on the edge, caught between the chronic boredom of his life and the disappointment of a failed romance. His chemistry with Binoche is magnetic, and surprising, it's so much stronger than the Binoche-Depp pairing of Chocolat.<br /><br /> The revelation of the film however is Juliette Binoche' terrific turn as Rose. The beautician who hides behind a mask of colouful makeup and only becomes truly beautiful the day she removes it.<br /><br /> Binoche in her first successful comic role (in Chocolat afterall she was a more tragic figure) succeeds in creating a wonderfully funny and charming young woman, with an endearingly vunerable side. Time after time Reno feeds her the lines and she returns with the best moments of the film. Two parts which stand out are when Felix assumes Rose is a prostitute and when she discusses her make-up routine with him. Binoche will probably be César nominated for her role, and because this is such a change in direction for her she may even win.<br /><br /> The best thing about ""Décalage Horaire"" is that it is not merely sentimental, it's ironic tone is winning and much more interesting. Thompson's assured directon shows signs of maturity since ""La buche"", while her writing is as astute as ever.<br /><br /> The ending in mexico to the strains of Macy Gray's redoubtable ""I try"" is a memorable ending, for it's immediacy and it's pure sheer pleasure.<br /><br /> Viva la Binoche!",Performance,Plot,
"Known as LONG AGO TOMORROW, THE RAGING MOON is possibly the most intriguing movie in the career of young Malcolm MacDowell. It came after his breakthrough film IF, and before the films most people recall he starred in: A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and O LUCKY MAN. MacDowell is nowadays established as a well known character actor who specializes in powerful or power-mad villains for the most part. On an episode of LAW AND ORDER a few years back he was a twisted version of Rupert Murdoch. He is frequently rogue CIA agents, or tycoons with secret agendas. And he is wonderful in all these roles. But except for O LUCKY MAN it is hard to find MacDowell playing a sympathetic and simple type. His salesman in O LUCKY MAN is naive and believes what line is ever given to him by his employers. But in THE RAGING MOON he was a strong, athletic young man whose future is wrecked by a physical accident that cripples him. And he has to try to fight his anger at this unfair situation and regain his self respect.<br /><br />McDowell plays Bruce Prichard, a soccer/rugby player who is injured in a game - and left wheelchair bound at the age of 21. Given that sport was the key to his life, the props have been knocked out from underneath him in more than one way. He slowly develops into a determined man who is going to overcome his permanent handicap. What really turns him into a determined type is his meeting with another patient (also similarly crippled) named Jill Matthews (Nanette Newman). The two young people find they are encouraging each other's recovery. And sooner or later they begin falling in love.<br /><br />It is the oddest role in MacDowell's career, and he handles very well. Basically, except for the first ten minutes of the film, he is stuck in bed or in his wheelchair. He is bitter, but fixed on getting on with his new life. Andd finally he is enchanted by his new friend, confidante, and lover Newman. In one of the most touching scenes of the film, the two lovers figure out how to embrace in their wheelchairs by turning them on parallel lines to each other, and lowering the right arms of the wheelchairs so they can surround their arms about each other's waists and chests. The viewer can see the difficulties the young people will face, but they see they will do what they can to overcome their joint disability. So that the audience ends up cheering for them.<br /><br />MacDowell is not usually so sympathetic. His anti-hero in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is tormented by the state in a new process to make him an acceptable (if defenseless) citizen, and then tormented by one of his old victims. But he was a stylish but still vicious punk in most of that film. He may symbolize youthful suspicions against an antiquated establishment in IF, but he is a violent rebel in the end. And due to his crass stupidity in O LUCKY MAN he actually commits fraud. But in THE RAGING MOON he struck a different note - and it was one he rarely hit again in any films or television shows he made. <br /><br />The ultimate fate of his hero and heroine, and the cruelty of the world and nature they face, enhance the film. At the conclusion he is stunned by events. So is his audience. And nobody can explain why what happened had to be final for his dreams.",Performance,,
"In the beginning of 2000, everyone waited impatiently, the release of the movie ""the beach"", mainly because Leonardo DiCaprio was in the main role. You thought that he was going to carry on with dignity, following the huge commercial and artistic success of ""Titanic"". But sadly, it's not the case. This movie that is a new variation of the lost paradise is a disappointment.<br /><br /> As far as I'm concerned, I saw the movie at the cinema when it was launched in February 2000 and I thought that it would focus only on DiCaprio, Ledoyen and Canet's efforts to discover this beach. Actually, my expectation was justified but it only lasts half an hour. When they discover the beach and they adhere to the community, I think the movie could have ended there. The second part (which starts with the three Swedish bitten by a shark) only plays the role of fill-in and spoils all the movie. Moreover, Danny Boyle eyes a bit too much towards the bloody.<br /><br />Otherwise, to put it mildly is that the dialogs of ""the beach"" are few inspired sometimes silly and too convenient with the situations. Sometimes, the movie turns out to be too predictable: before the love affair between DiCaprio and Ledoyen, you guess that a love story will start between them. And, inevitably, it will cause Canet's jealousy but this jealousy will spread to Ledoyen she learns that DiCaprio had sex with Sal during their stay in Bangkok. Besides, the performance appears quite mixed: Ledoyen and Canet are paling into insignifiance next to DiCaprio. Another thing I noticed: DiCaprio' voice-off doesn't succeed in making the movie gripping as it was the case with Edward Norton in ""Fight Club"".<br /><br />Then, let's admit it: the end of the movie seems too easy and conventional. You guess before the end that the perfect paradise doesn't exist on earth and certainly not in Thailand: there are sharks, it's not always shiny and Sal, the leader of the community reveals herself to be despotic and finally cruel. Let's add that the ""paradise keepers"" will do anything to protect their territory, even to kill...<br /><br />Nevertheless, the movie enjoys a shiny photography that reflects brilliantly the color of the sea and the beach. Landscapes are magnificient and there's a good original soundtrack which includes Moby's porcelain. But these qualities aren't sufficient enough to save the movie. A disappointing and predictable movie and somewhere unfinished. You can blame Boyle for not revealing the reasons of Daffy's suicide.",Music,Plot,
"I agree with the previous comment.<br /><br />I saw this movie at an outdoor summer screening in a local park, and it was brilliant to hear the sounds of the metal we know and love pounding out through the park on a Sunday night.<br /><br />The film was a considered, thoughtful journey through some of the questions that plague the minds of those who aren't part of the metal community. Such as what the fans are like, how they get into metal, why they stay with metal and rarely stray from the various genres that it has. Others include sexuality, girls in metal, and so on.<br /><br />Each aspect of the documentary was soundly explored, rationally argued, and balanced. For instance, on the one hand you get the perspective of groupies, and then of groupies from bands. You get differing opinions.<br /><br />In fact, the documentary is a boon for both the metal community and the non-metal community alike. On the one hand, the mettles can revel in the exploration of their community and genres; on the other, the wider community can gain some real insight into the workings of the community.<br /><br />I must admit that some of the humour that our (predominantly metal) audience felt at the posturing of the Norwegian Black Metal scene, and other parts, the rest of the audience didn't necessarily get. The humour is often something which you must be part of the community to understand, which is why it all appears so serious to the rest of society: they don't get the humour.<br /><br />All in all, a well-wrought, skillfully crafted, and well argued documentary. Of course there were subgenres and things missing, but you get that with all docos - there just isn't the time to do it. Given the limitations, Metal: a headbanger's journey, makes the most of it and does it well.<br /><br />Highly recommended viewing.",Others,,
"Let's start at the end. Direct discussion of the point of the whole story could hardly be a spoiler, since the final success or failure f this point is left for readers to discover, if they are still interested. If fact, if the film makers had made the point explicit at th very beginning, they would have made a much better movie. But to demonstrate how they have subverted the best interests of the film, here are three comments from three recent reviewers expressing confusion as to the identity of the woman at the core of the story: ""The virus they thought the girl might have was never explained. Beyond that it made her some kinda bomb, maybe... But wouldn't they be afraid of catching it?"" - dkpedigo.<br /><br />""What he does not know, but soon learns is the knowledge the girl may be a sleeper threat to him, his boss and to those who don't want the girl to live after she arrives in America."" - thinker1691.<br /><br />""According to the film, the Neolites needed Aurora intact so they could establish their religion by showing that one of their own had twin virgin births."" - bnvrohm.<br /><br />I actually ran through the end of this film three times before I finally got it: A virus is devastating North America and Aurora is a test-tube baby genetically designed to produce a race of superhumans who can survive the virus (by healing very rapidly) and reproduce without sex (which has left Aurora a side-effect of intense empathy). Consequently, the battle between the two scientists who effectively designed her is one of control, neither of them wants her dead, no matter what else they feel for her or what other use they may have for her. The former point needs explaining which never occurs in the film, and the latter point is senselessly obscured by the intense violence of the last major gun battle. And the decision to make both points mysterious has led to a conclusion that is confusing and unsatisfying, both intellectually and emotionally. I won't tell you exactly what happens, that would spoil it; but I suggest that after you've seen it you'll wonder if you care.<br /><br />That said, the film is not a total loss as cynical sci-fi action film. Diesal actually gives a good performance here. There are some exciting action set-pieces, the dramatic and satiric set-pieces are occasionally intriguing, and the world of Babylon AD may be unpleasant but it is fully realized, which is the first demand for any sci-fi film.<br /><br />But there's no doubt the story needed much more thought and better control than we see here. This journey should be leading somewhere, but when we get there, we wonder why we bothered.",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"I didn't even know that Freakazoid existed until I looked at YouTube. I watched a couple episodes of it and I thought it was one of the funniest shows ever made. I couldn't stop laughing at the completely random humor and satire scattered throughout. It was a bit closer in tone to shows like The Simpsons or Rocky and Bullwinkle. Freakazoid acted less like a real superhero and more like, well a cartoon character. There were also other funny segments like Lord Bravery, Fatman and Boy Blubber, The Huntsman, etc., It was basically one of those shows where story didn't really matter and it was just there to make you laugh. It is such a shame that this brilliantly hilarious show only lasted two seasons. This is my fourth favorite cartoon, right after The Simpsons, Futurama, and Pinky & The Brain.",Plot,,
"I saw Pariah on television and I thought it was a TV-movie made in the early 90s. I was quite shocked to then discover that it had been made a recently as 1998, after both American History X (AHX) and Romper Stomper. Had it have been made earlier I would have forgiven its amateurish feel and, to be frank, embarrassing handling of the plot and story line.<br /><br />A good way of seeing how ineffective this movie is, is to compare it with the things it is trying to emulate. The story itself (for those unaware) is lifted directly from The Crow by J O'Barr. If you want to see the same plot idea handled in an incredibly powerful, subtle and truly masterful way then read the comic (not the film). I'd class Pariah's handling of the neo-Nazi aspect as being more like Romper Stomper in the way it superficially deals with the matter. However Romper Stomper does it so much better.<br /><br />To focus on the movie itself, it's all very poor. The acting is poor, the scripts are poor, the directing poor....the whole thing is just poor. Some scenes had me flinching with embarrassment they were so bad. Despite the fact that I'm slating it, I still gave it 4/10. If it's on television and you have nothing better to do then watch it, it'll pass the time, it's not *that* bad. But if you enjoy the violent neo-Nazi romanticising movie then watch Romper Stomper as it's better. If you enjoy the revenge theme then read (or, to a lesser extent, watch) The Crow. I don't really want to draw any comparisons with AHX as that movie is in a different league and is one of my all-time favourite movies. AHX is the thinking man's Romper Stomper....I wouldn't even want to say what AHX is in relation to Pariah.<br /><br />",Plot,Performance,Directional Techniques

"I couldn't make it through the whole thing. It just wasn't worth my time. Maybe one-fourth of the dialogue would have been worth listening to (or reading -- since I don't understand French) if the pseudo-profundity and pseudo-wittiness of the other three-fourths of the film were deleted. Then it could be made into a short maybe 13 or 15 min long and then it might be all right.<br /><br />I don't know why this movie even pretends to utilize actors. Actors are used as narrators of the script and little more. I could swear a whole 20-30 minutes of the film went by showing actors from behind while they talked and from across the street while they walked or sitting in low lighting close up but so that you could not see the expressions on their faces nor their eyes. There was little or no interaction between the actors on the screen except the most superficial for the most part.<br /><br />Some of the lines were as profound (or lame, depending on your viewpoint) as those in Forest ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" Gump. Other pseudo-profundities were simply sad or dumb or poetic (depending again on your viewpoint), but singularly uninspiring.<br /><br />Visually this film is INCREDIBLY boring, especially with the lack of actors. In fact some minutes of this film showed simply a black screen with the white subtitles and French audio. Altogether sophomoric. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />If you like GOOD movies that are stimulating and profound just from listening to conversation while enjoying good actors, check out RICHARD LINKLATER's ""Before Sunset"" -- or make a double feature of it and watch ""Before Sunrise"" first. At least these films are interesting and enjoyable, which is much more than I can say about IN PRAISE OF LOVE (Éloge de l'amour). I give this film 2 out of 10 stars. Not quite offensive enough to rate 1 for ""awful"" (such as ""The Devils"" with Oliver Reed and Vanessa Redgrave). If you still want to watch it, go ahead.

"This movie is terribly bad. I don't know how this ¿script? passed any kind of selection. I must say that it is under the level of the actors in the movie, and, believe me, that's not easy. It's really sad to see that not one, but ¡three! directors, with all their talent together, are unable to overcome the level of shame.<br /><br />In the beginning, Nancho Novo's faces, remembering some sexual-criminal scene, already promises the absurd and bad-done development of the rest of the movie. The mixture of Madrid's ""movida"" and the deep feelings and the thriller atmosphere is really pathetic. The personal stories of the characters have been seen thousand times before, although the directors show them as very interesting and full of deep passion. The violent ending adds more absurd stupidity to the plot.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not a surprise to see how bad this film is. It is part of a sort of genre of Spanish bad movies, trying to imitate Almodovar's model, believing that filming sex, gay ambient, drugs and frenetic passions makes a movie a good movie. Unfortunately for these three directors, if you have a stupid story nothing works. And I guess that's what they will always have in their (I hope short) careers.",Plot,,
"I truly consider Tightrope to be by far one of Eastwood's best acting performances. He definitely DID deserve, that year, at least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. And don't be mistaken, Wes Block has nothing to do with Dirty Harry ... true, these two cops both have their ""dark side"" -an aspect that Eastwood has learned to exploit in a number of his pictures, BUT Wes Block appears to be much more ""human"" than Harry. This single father is struggling with his own demons, persuaded that until now he has screwed up about everything in his life, beginning with his marriage ... he's trying real hard to be a good father, as well as a good cop, that is until this killer comes along and threatens all he's been fighting for to preserve.<br /><br />Here we get to know a guy who's extremely vulnerable, hurt, un-self confident, haunted and whose relationship with women remains ambiguous, based on control, kind of as if he was afraid of them, of what they could do to him, seeing them as a threat ... hence his resort to the services of prostitutes and his use of handcuffs on them.<br /><br />As usual in Eastwood's movies, we wanna know what's underneath this front his characters put on ... -like in Pale Rider, Josey Wales, The Bridges of Madison County ... the silences, the puzzling, haunting, deep looks, that tell us far more about a character than any word would. ""Less is more"" is definitely a guideline of this movie. Most of the time, Eastwood's characters reveal themselves through their silences, and it's particularly true here.<br /><br />I believe there's a line in Tightrope that sums up pretty accurately what Eastwood's movies are really about: ""I'm not sure how close I wanna get ..."" They're about very private men struggling with life.<br /><br />This movie is simply one of his best.",Performance,Plot,

This is another one of those films where third party, completely random characters become the culprits, and defeat the purpose of getting to know the main characters in the first place.<br /><br />The positive things that I can say is that they do sort of tie some things together at the end (although the results will only serve to tick most people off).

People all over the world aren't monkeys anymore, as we believed in past centuries. They are even as proud as some US citisens are and that's what ore small world keep spinning around.

The old Iran is crumbling, while Amiro, the child hero, rejects all of it as he ""runs"" metaphorically to survive. <br /><br />Naderi photographs Amiro like Tom Sawyer on his journey down The Mississippi, a child joining the changing society of the Persian Gulf.

"When I wrote about this show for the first time, I did it after the pilot episode. But after 7 episodes, I feel myself able to truly say something about it.<br /><br />As I said for the first time, Candace Bushnell knows a lot about women and New York and that's why she has a lot to tell. Sex And The City was about the searching for the true love and not about power, and Lipstick Jungle is about power and the search of a truly self that's hidden somewhere, and it's an interesting plot. What I feel after 7 episodes is that for sure is an interesting plot, but the show is getting a lot late to make it interesting.<br /><br />The show focuses the lives of 3 friends placed between the 50 most powerful women in the world. All of them has well designed personalities but none that we haven't seen before as the insecure and family troubled Wendy (Brook Shields), a movie producer that despite her insecureness she makes right decisions in her work but it's kind hard for her to tie work and family; the self confident but unhappy Nico (Kim Raver), a magazine editor who is moved by challenges and is tired to be ignored by a husband that never gives her the attention she deserves; and the lovely and believer Victory Ford, a fashion designer that wants to conquer the world in her own impulsive and sentimental ways and is dealing for the first time with the downs of her career.<br /><br />The cast is quite good but it's kinda hard to feel a great chemistry between them when they're all together but that's OK because most part of the time the story sets each one of them individually. Brook Shields is good even if sometimes she looks like playing ""Suddenly Susan"" again, but her character is always surrounded by a lot of happenings being hard to follow all the issues at the same time. Lindsay Price is a lot unfamiliar to me because she's been in countless shows but I can't remember her in any of them, anyway, she surprises me a lot when I got myself laughing with some of her moments, but her character stills being quite weak to be placed as ""one of the 50 most powerful women"" in the show. Kim Raver is by far the best choice because she's proving to be one of the best TV actresses of the time, she's always a lot convincing and her character is for sure the best edged of the show, her previous works with strong characters like Kathlyn Hale in ""The Nine"", or Audrey Raines in ""24"" and Kim Zambrano in ""Third Watch"" gave her great bases for the confidence and the dramatic lines that Nico needs and Lipstick Jungle is being all about her and she deserves this attention after so many supporting roles.<br /><br />The show lacks of some prime attentions and qualities that made Sex And The City a great thing. New York is being a lot secondary in the plot and that's a shame because this city is a living character for Bushnell's stories. The characters still not being interesting enough (except Nico for the reasons above), and the male characters are being very unnecessary than it should. The plot is flowing in slow motion and after so wrong twists seems like the writers are finally getting in their shape after hard 7 episodes. Now I can see that some really interesting things are trying to come and the show is finally and slowly getting its way. A lot of changes has been made from its pilot, but the show screams for further important turns with urgency.<br /><br />It's a nice show, and it's being hard to forget it because, as I said, looks like it's finally getting its right tone, and if it does and they kick it right, it promises to be not as fabulous as Sex And The City, but admirable.",Performance,Directional Techniques,

Yes, ""Venus and Mars"" is THAT bad! Not only that it's a bad film, it's also a waste of money, time and talent: Lynn Redgrave was delightfully funny - let's make this peculiar -in ""Gods and Monsters"". Ryan Hurst was great in ""Remember the Titans"". I just love ""Dark Angel"" - and not just because the spunky charm and great looks of Jessica Alba, but also because of Michael Weatherly, whose brilliant, low-key performance single-handedly provides a counter-balance to the series' outrageously futuristic plot. Why all these great actors (and some others in the cast) didn't chose to act, would even puzzle Melville's Bartleby. Let Variety proclaim that the announced Actors Strike was narrowly avoided - I'd say that it did happen indeed: and it happened during the shooting of this film. But then again, why should they have put any effort into this cheesy train wreck of a romantic comedy: the plot is somewhat appealing in its naiveté - four girlfriends return to their German hometown to mourn the death of their soccer-coach - but it's the kind of 'nice' idea that needs great dialogue, perfect execution, charming ambiance and romantic spirit to come to fruition. Needless to say, all of this is lacking in ""Venus and Mars"". The dialogues don't just border on the ridiculous - it's fair to say that it's miles south of the border, let alone the equator. The pacing is uneven. Continuity in the case of this film only means that the celluloid does not tear. And when all girls find their perfect guy in the end (no spoiler, that's what we expect from a romantic comedy), the audience does not swoon, but is bound to groan loudly. There is the name of a director in the credits - but somehow I doubt he exists. If he does, I would not even let him direct cart-traffic on a golf-course, because of the legal ramifications, let alone the bloodshed. He might have said ""action"" and ""cut"" during the filming, but so does a parrot. As for the leading lady Daniela Lunkewitz, I do have to surmise that she is no Meg Ryan - or Jeri Ryan, for that matter. ""Venus and Mars"" is the kind of romantic-comedy nobody needs - and I'll have to take my hat off to the investors and the unsuspecting patrons who bought a ticket. Charity is rare these days - but I'd like to suggest that there are causes out there far more worthy of your 8 bucks or the few millions that were pumped into this little endeavor.",Plot,Performance,Directional Techniques
"Vampire Hookers is certainly a bad movie but that is part of its charm. If you are a fan of 70's T&A films, this one will should appeal to you. I first saw it at an old downtown theater that ran mostly B horror movies and soft core porn. That was many years ago so I guess something about this film impressed me as I have never quite forgotten it although some of the people in the cast would probably like to.<br /><br />My main question is, what is John Carradine doing in this? I know he was at the end of a fine career (hey, the guy was in Stagecoach and The Grapes of Wrath for crying out loud) but Vampire Hookers?!? I can only guess that he either A. needed the money, B. wanted to help out a producer or director friend, or C. lost a bet in a poker game with this film's producer.",Performance,,
"I caught this movie really late at night on the Sci-Fi Channel - aka Insomniac Central - which seems to proudly own the rights to every bad movie ever made. If you think their daytime programming is awful, you should check out what they wait until after midnight to air.<br /><br />Movies like this.<br /><br />It was a 120-minute train wreck that I truly couldn't take my eyes off of. I have seriously been witness to one of the worst movies ever made, complete with a cast that, if they play their cards right, might one day graduate to bigger and better roles in amateur porn.<br /><br />It's nothing you haven't seen before - typical giant bug of the day run amok due to irresponsible toxic waste dumping movie (complete with exclamation point) - only worse. It's an anachronism in a way - a throwback to those cheap giant bug creatures of the 50's. Only this one isn't played for camp.<br /><br />It actually takes itself seriously.<br /><br />There is, though, one reason to check this out during one of the 1,265 times that Sci-Fi will re-air it over the next 5 months: 'The Dance' scene must be witnessed to be believed.",Visual Effect,Plot,

Shallow, predictable plot, VERY poorly acted bad-ole-good-ole-boys film that never misses a cliché. I would never have viewed it but for some stills from the jail scene of Mimieux. She really lowers herself from the pedestal I'd put her on in ""The Time Machine."" Weena, where have you gone? ;- (<br /><br />And how did they get so many otherwise worthy actors? I hardly recognized Tommy Lee Jones and Carradine. As for Howard Hesseman and Betty White, where have their standards gone? I could understand it if it was a first film for these guys - it's as if a director put a gun to the actors' heads, threw up the script and gave them one reading and on to the next scene.<br /><br />And is it possible to get a worse soundtrack? This movie has cheap written all over it. I'm going to do vidcaps of Yvette in the jail scene and toss this thing before it festers and affects others.",Performance,Music,
"Ah, Race cars. Gotta love 'em. I'm not a huge fan of NASCAR myself, but hey, whenever I'm over at my Grandpa's house sometimes, I'll sit and watch. It's fun, and it sure is better than being bored when your laptop can't get any internet (which is true, though I'll use their desktop sometimes). Watching those shiny little cars race down the racetrack at full speed sure is exciting, and is an edge-of-the-seat pastime activity, because it sure gets your adrenaline going.And it's also nice to see every single tiny space of the seating capacity packed 'till there's no seats for more people is nice, because it's interesting to see how many people would have spent hard earned cash to see this big event. I've never been to a racing course myself, but I sure as hell hope that next summer I can go to the Edmonton Indy. Sure as hell looks fun. I'll see if I can check it out!<br /><br />But now that I got my NASCAR crap out of my system, racing cars can be fun. But has anyone ever thought of racing cars... while in prison??? With extra guns and shields added to your car, so you can kill any son of a bitch that gets in your way? Well, if anyone has ever wanted to see that, come one come all to DEATH RACE- the new film from Paul W.S. Anderson. That sounds dumb, doesn't it? Well guess what- IT AIN'T DUMB TO ME!!!!!! Having wanted to see it since the trailer showed with Wanted, I was excited when I walked into the theater to see it because it looked fun and cool. I think Jason Statham is a great actor. He has given us performances in some of my favorite movies like Crank, The Transporter Movies, and Ghosts of mars.<br /><br />*WARNING: The following may contain spoilers* Jason Statham (Crank, War, Ghosts of Mars) stars as Jensen, a hard-working construction worker whose company has been shut down for good. When the SWAT team arrive and start forcing people to get out, Jensen comes home to his beautiful wife and baby, and his wife is just making dinner when the baby starts to cry. Jensen goes upstairs to calm the baby down. While this happens, Jensen's wife turns around and sees an assassin behind her. Oh noes! This doesn't sound good! When Jensen comes down the stairs, he finds that his wife has been murdered (and I tell you, it ain't a pretty sight). The assassin is still in the house, to make things even worse, if that's possible. Jensen is knocked out and the police mistake him for the killer, and is sent to prison on charges of murdering his wife. It's sad, isn't it?<br /><br />Prison ain't such a fun place. Especially when getting your food spat in. That is made true when he gets into a fight with some tough guys there, and after that spat, he is sent to Hennessey's (Joan Allen, The Bourne Supremacy) office, where he is told that he has one chance to get out: DEATH RACE, a game in which you win 5 races to get out of prison for your own life. A previous racer, Frankenstein, has played and died. Jensen takes Frankie's place, and joins Coach (Ian McShane, Shrek the Third) and 2 other people, who help him get set up and other stuff. While racing against 14K, Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson, The Fast and the Furious), he gets a hot chick named Case, (Natalie Martinez, breakout actress) who is his partner, and together they race and try to find a way out of there. However, what Jensen finds out is that the man who killed his wife is in there, and he'll do whatever it takes to get back at him while still in there!<br /><br />Death Race is a fun-filled romp through violence, blood and gore, and so many other things. Jason Statham is great and well cast in the movie, and he is a great actor too. Tyrese Gibson gives a great spin to the film himself. Joan Allen is pretty scary as Hennessey, and even has the movie's best line: ""OK, c-cksucker, f-ck with me. See who sh-ts on the sidewalk."" How that line was conceived, I don't know. But it sure is a great one liner. The race scenes are edge-of-your-seat fun. Great camera-work, and great explosions as well. The only thing I didn't like was that the movie was too short. It felt like it was only 40 minutes to me really, but otherwise that must be a good sign, because it's a fast paced thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. If you ever wanted to see cars racing in prison, this is it, baby!",Performance,Plot,
"A later re-viewing, or perhaps speaking Farsi, might lead me to a greater appreciation of this film. Iranian cinema is something I am just starting to explore and surely appreciate, but this film failed to draw me in as say ""Gabbeh,"" ""Dayareh"" or ""Color of Paradise"" did.<br /><br />Of course the lead character, is intentionally enigmatic; opaque to us in terms of why he might seek suicide. The landscape is a harsh, bitter orange, almost as if he were in some form of hell already. For me, never having a connection with this lead character, pushes me towards those he encounters...but they too are distant. Indeed the point of the first two, is their wanting to maintain that distance. Contrast this with the film ""Goodbye, Solo"" (coincidentally by an Iranian-American, or perhaps vice versa), where the depth of the characters, despite a remote lead, was remarkable. But of course that was in English, so perhaps Farsi-speakers would resonate more here with the characters.<br /><br />Certainly the third passenger, was the most fascinating. And the fact that his job is a taxidermist, quite a nice touch. And perhaps more familiarity with the Koran would have helped me in the echoes of the film.<br /><br />Anyways, this film reminds me of stage play (it was not one originally), which works fine for me typically but I think for some viewers that can be a bit of a turn-off. The slow pace is also mentioned, but this pace is nothing compared to Angelopoulos' amazing work, so again that is not what failed for me. I saw this *before* reading Jonathan Rosenbaum's ""Movie Wars"" where he frequently cites this film as one of his all-time favorites.<br /><br />I think this is a great film for film critics, as it is an open film in a way, open to wide-ranging interpretation. Is the filmmaker himself embarking on his own suicide of sorts in making this film in/for Iran? I mentioned the taxidermist, one who preserves the dead in a life-like state, and the other passengers are those who can be seen as people who are chartered with protecting and/or killing other people, but when it comes to a single person, that is more trying.<br /><br />So perhaps there is more open than the grave in this film, regrettably at this point I am a casual casualty. Perhaps watching this with others instead of solo would have helped me, alas I say ""Goodbye"" to this buy hopefully another hello to Kiarostomi.<br /><br />4/10 Thurston Hunger",Performance,Directional Techniques,

"This movie did make me feel for the woman because of her illness, and for the cancer it made me feel like she has hope... of dieing.<br /><br />Her illness is that she is 100% materialistic and shallow and has no idea of how to live a happy life and even the fact that she is dieing, which she finds out as the movie begins, cannot seem to give her any willpower to think on how to really find any real substance to what life she has left.<br /><br />Not only does she seem to live in a void of meaning, but the entire movie and the way the effects are used seem to emphasize emotions to things that have no meaning whatsoever, as if the people behind the plot of the movie have no substance, and no understanding of any better ways to bring some color in to life then buying new curtains and such.<br /><br />Even though events take different turns towards the end, she still doesn't learn anything new, and the movie remains with the same shallow thought that is started out with: spend more, take risks and you'll be happier.<br /><br />To be fare, if buying stuff is the best thing you can imagine, if it is all you live for, then this movie probably isn't all bad for you.",Plot,Performance,
"The film starts with a bawdy song unmistakably naughty and then follows ever so much suggestive but clever dialogue. There is wicked and mischievous goings-on in and around a beautiful home on the road between Paris and Avignon. This is where Denis Diderot (Vincent Perez) is compiling and printing his banned multi-volume encyclopaedia. My goodness! I had no idea that a 17th Century philosopher could have so much fun putting into print some of his thoughts and experiences. ""If it's natural"" he says ""It must be good for you"". He not only says it, but practises it, and no woman seems safe from his ardent approaches.<br /><br />Amongst all the farcical nonsense, there is some heavy satire on the church's attitude to sex. exotic foods such as chocolate and caviare, musical scores (the pig organ is a delight) and banned literature. Vincent Perez as Diderot plays the character superbly wearing a delightful smile though not much else when he poses for his portrait by the beautiful Madame Therbouche, a so-called painter from Berlin though actually a spy arranged by the Cardinal. Her mission is to locate the clandestine printing presses.<br /><br />There is plenty of action in the film (and never a dull moment) as Diderot prances naked around the surrounding gardens much to the disgust of the Cardinal. Much of the action is around the Cardinal who must be prevented from finding the printing presses. This is easily arranged by recruiting as many ladies as possible to seek confession of their sins before the Cardinal. Besides attending to his clerical duties, he seems not uninterested in their wickedness.<br /><br />Finally Diderot falls in love with Madame Therbouche as he seeks her assistance in the preparation of Volume X111. She agrees of course and why not? The last volume is to be all about sensuality, a subject in which both of them are so well versed.<br /><br />An absolute delight!",Directional Techniques,Plot,Visual Effect
"This movie mixes several points together. They are not exactly seamlessly joined, true, but each is followable and interesting in its own right. In no particular order, we have the irony of ex-Wehrmacht officers and men doing quite all right in the 1960s Wirtschaftskwelle of Germany. One of the characters we've been following remarks that these damned Spaniards and Italians he now has working for him in his factory don't know how to make Volkswagons. Then there is the overall context in which the Germans are losing the war, but nothing much is made of this except to the extent that it generates a movement among (some of) the officers to eliminate Hitler, a movement about which Major Grau (Omar Sharif), investigating the slaughter of a prostitute, observes cynically that it took quite a while for the movement to develop since the army seemed satisfied enough as long as they were winning. <br /><br />The French police officer who is helping him (the ever-sympatico Philippe Noiret) asks Major Grau why he is obsessed with tracking down the murderer of a whore in the midst of mass demise, and Grau says he resents the murderer's thinking he can play God. Noiret asks, ""And you can?"" Grau replies neatly, ""My blasphemy is on a smaller, more secular scale."" (Some of the dialog is pretty good.) Omar Sheriff gives what may be his finest performance on film. He may have been all masculine in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but here he is effete, suggestive in the most delicate way of homosexuality. It's in the way he holds a cigarette, the way he dances up a flight of stairs.<br /><br />The search for the murderer, whose identity is stupefyingly obvious shortly into the picture, provides a police procedural that forms the movie's spine or at any rate its notochord. There is even a romance that is not simply thrown in but is fairly well integrated into the plot and important to the outcome. The cast is good -- and what a caste! Peter O'Toole has been criticized for repeating his neurotic tricks from Lawrence of Arabia, but I didn't find it derivative at all. Lawrence was subtly mad. General Tanz is completely, screamingly, eye-twitchingly, dripping with sweatly, NUTS. There are two scenes in which Tanz enters a locked room to view ""decadent art."" One of them is a self portrait of Van Gogh. In each scene Tanz and Vincent stare back at one another, two psychotics, and ""I know exactly who you are"" seems to be written all over Van Gogh's scowling face. Both times Tanz is overcome and seems to dissolve into a myoclonic fit. <br /><br />The novel by Hans Helmutt Kirst was a lot funnier than the movie, taking advantage of every opportunity to poke fun at German military precision. But there are still amusing incidents left in the film. When Grau meets Tanz at a fancy reception and begins to query him, Tanz leans forward with an expression of distaste and asks, ""Are you wearing PERFUME?"" Grau, never flappable, replies, ""I use a rather strong cologne."" I don't understand, though, why Tanz wears the uniform of a Wermacht general through most of the film, then shows up at his last confrontation with Grau dressed as an SS officer. <br /><br />Maurice Jarre was writing effective scores in the late 60s. His ""crazy music"" sounds like an accompaniment to a marionette show that, when one thinks about it, isn't entirely inappropriate. The murderer meets his just end (while sensibly drunk as a skunk in the novel) but the story is fundamentally a tragic one. Too many deaths of good people. Too many lives ruined for nothing. What a shame the Hitler plot didn't work. It should ideally have been mounted back in 1938.",Plot,Performance,

The last point is a source of some concern to this moviegoer, WF can be funny, and he can be very funny and as seen in Stranger Than Fiction this pony has more than one trick but what I have been seeing more recently is a series of choices that leave me questioning how long until people stop paying him to be in their 'comedies.'

"Director Roberta Findley, wife of cult legend Michael, directs yet another bizarre, cheaply made, vulgar film. This one, Lurkers, named for the dead that can be seen by some ""lurking"" about, primarily tells the tale of a girl having a bad home life in New York in an apartment house where she sees these lurkers. We are introduced to her in a somewhat inventive and at the same time crude opening sequence where the young girl, having just been verbally/physically abused by her mother, goes outside to play and while playing jump rope - the rope mysteriously entwines around her neck as the children idly smile and watch. A young woman who will be seen later in the movie arrives, and the rope stops. Quickly we move to the present when the young girl has turned into a young musician in love with a photographer. The film then relates this relationship - but to say any more would give away the plot. And I wouldn't want to do that to you - or would I(might save you!) I think of all about this film that I did like - and granted that was not much - was the story. It is somewhat talky and you soon know where it is going, but it has shades reminiscent of Rosemary's Baby with regards to the man-woman relationship and a future conspiracy. I even thought the end, reminiscent of The Sentinel, was just quirky enough to be interesting. The real problem with this movie is that it never can shake the cheap look and feel it has. This can be easily seen in the settings, the lack of good, quality actors, and the special effects(what few there are). Christine Moore plays the lead - and she is pretty - but beyond that nothing very special. She is better than virtually everyone else in the film. Findley also has some obvious, how shall we say, peculiar interests as we are shown various scenes suggesting sexual aberration of some kind and scenes suggesting sick violence with a sledge hammer. The film is not particularly gory though. One scene that stood out for me was a scene between two beautiful models - both highly attractive - disrobing and talking about the stock market. It has nothing to do with anything yet has an interesting humorous edge as well as other pluses aimed to peak one's interest.",Plot,Performance,

"Every comment here seems to be trying to analyse this film. Don't. It is a sickening film. The whole premise that a man (and you could probably have inserted a woman in a similar role) can purposely go and commit such emotional horror is soul destroying. that's what makes this such compulsive viewing. There can't be a person out there who hasn't at one point deliberately taken an action that has had similar repercussions. Emotionally cruelty is the worst cruelty of all.<br /><br />The performances are straight out of reality and when coupled with the direction it made me feel that I was a fly on the wall. That's what hurt. Chad's character is not over-the-top as suggested elsewhere in here. You can pick a Chad out in plenty of places. Unfortunately the stereotyped male leads (superstud and nerdy) spoil the film a bit and whilst a deaf girl isn't exactly a character you can despise, her deafness becomes increasingly irrelevant as the film goes on (as seen by the emotional bonds that develop between the nerd and Christine).<br /><br />Ultimately it doesn't say anything about the male psyche or relationships, but it does show an extreme version of the kind of emotional cruelty of which we are all capable.",Plot,Performance,

Thereafter, the recruit settles in the Ironbound section of Newark, NJ, and is responsible for many of that area's unsolved murders and missing persons since then. Among the characters to whom we are introduced during the film are a detective, who writes a book about these events; and a doctor, who helps capture the never-aging bloodsucker. Gore is almost nil.

"Another cool atmospheric vampire film that's a sequel to Dracula and Dracula's Daughter, but can stand alone since there's no reference to the previous films.<br /><br />Lon Chaney Jr. plays the Son of Dracula. He's ok as Dracula, but much better as the Wolf Man. Anyhow, He travels under the alias ""Count Alucard"" (Dracula spelled backwards) to America to marry a woman who is secretly just trying to gain eternal life so that she can spread it to her real love interest who she was supposed to marry in the first place.<br /><br />This is a pretty original story. And it's the only one of the Universal classic Dracula films where we actually see the vampires turn into mist, and the first one where we actually SEE Dracula turn into a bat. I like this film.<br /><br />There's an on going debate as to whether the Dracula in this film is supposed to be the same Dracula that Bela Lugosi played. I disagree. The reasons being because we saw Bela Lugosi's Dracula killed and burned in the previous two films. And the vampire expert in Son of Dracula, Dr. Lazlo, said that this one is probably a descendant of the original Dracula. Lastly, I think the title says it all - although there are people who seem to think that this is just a common sequel title used back then and is not meant to be taken literally. But it was taken literally with Son of Frankenstein, and this is a follow up to ""Dracula's DAUGHTER"" (who really WAS his daughter) so... But anyway, on the back of the video case, it says that Lon Chaney is playing the son of Dracula. So I don't think it can be more clearer that the Dracula we see in Son of Dracula IS the SON of Dracula like the title suggests.<br /><br />In the end, this film is worth watching if you can take it in its historical context. Otherwise you won't enjoy this film, because it's not up to today's standards of horror. But for the time period, this film was a good horror film.<br /><br />8 out of 10.",Plot,Performance,
"The Leopard Man is a triumph of style over content. The plot of an escaped leopard terrifying a community certainly justifies calling this a horror film, but it succeeds as a minor masterpiece in the genre only because of the elegant direction and cinematography, which took advantage of the black and white medium. In the DVD Val Lewton Collection , Citizen Kane is mentioned frequently, both for its artistry and for its financial disappointment; (though I have read that in fact it turned a small profit.) Also mentioned are the films of Astaire and Rogers, and their use of black and white photography. It may be that Lewton and company learned from their RKO predecessors, especially Citizen Kane; in this case to cast an ominous aura over the action. The color black is the key, from the time that the leading lady decides to wear a black gown for her night club entrance with the leopard. The leopard image is used to foreshadow the deaths of the two young girls. In one case the black hand shadow of a leopard head made by her brother hangs over and behind her head as she leaves the house. In the other, the mother of the second victim is seen carrying a black cat in her arms. Then there is the Ace of Spades dealt to Margo by the fortune teller on two occasions. All very stylish! If not for the men behind the scenes the film would have been lost in the abyss of B films gone and also forgotten. The performances are about as wooden as one would expect in a typical B film, with only Margo conveying some of the tension one would expect from persons in a small town with a frightened leopard on the loose. However, special note should be taken of Dynamite, the big cat who receives billing, possibly as a result of his terrifying performance in Cat People, when he set the stage for the action, chewing on a large roast in his cage. However, one cannot help but be puzzled by the fact that a black panther is playing a leopard (which in this film did change his spots). Did RKO have him under a long-term contract? Comparing his performance with those of the actors reminds me of the supposed comment of director van Dyke after the filming of Rose Marie, starring Nelson Eddy as a mountie: ""It was easier to get a good performance from his horse than it was from Nelson"".",Plot,Directional Techniques,Performance
"I don't speak Norwegian..not a single word...but I didn't read half the subtitles of this movie, I was so engrossed in the visuals. When I watched it again, I read the subtitles...and realized that I had understood the entire thing despite the lack of paying attention to language. That said...this movie was stunning. It was quite long, and there were a few bits that dragged a bit, but the good made up for the not-as-good ten times. The photography of the Norwegian landscape is astounding, and the acting is subtle and completely believable. The dialog is more sparse than most movies that I've seen, but adding a single word more would become verbose. This is the story of a young woman in medieval Europe who rebells against what she is expected to do and lives to get what she wants, and deals with the consequences which run deep.

"This impressive time capsule of late-seventies/early-eighties NY is poignant at times, but still fun to watch. On the surface it's an anti-establishment teen film, but at its heart there is a deeper message about having confidence in yourself in spite of what others want you to believe to be true about who you are.<br /><br />Alan Moyle creates a moving sophomore directorial effort, while Robin Johnson, Trini Alvarado, and Tim Curry shine in their well-developed roles. Robin Johnson especially gives a great and underrated performance.<br /><br />If you have a soft side for 1980's teen films, do not miss this one.",Performance,Plot,
"Wow. I was glad I rented this movie. Actually it just so happens that my teen boys and I sat down and watched this movie together. We don't do that often, but ""Animal"" gave us a lot to think about. Ving Rhames' performance was his best, thus far! I like the fact that we see the side of the criminal that most films don't show, a person who really truly wants to change from what he used to be and into what his true purpose is in life. Terrence Howard, of course, always breaths life and realness into his characters. I felt sorry for his character as, again, we see the reality that young African-American men, although urged to grow up real fast in the face of taking the big responsibility of heading the household (forgive the run-ons), still have this little kid inside of them who thirsts/screams to be a young child, held and loved. All of the actors were great, the script was great, and Ving Rhames'crying scene in which he goes back into his childhood, is superb. I know my sons were so effected by ""Animal"" because we talked about 20 minutes after the movie ended about the Willie Lynch letter and the boys asked questions and I answered as best I could. I was so impressed with ""Animal that weeks later I searched to buy a VHS version for at least one hour at a local movie rental house. I was disappointed I couldn't find it on VHS.

"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story was full of plot holes, the camera and cutting was confusing at best and with the acting on level with kindergarten Christmas plays I cannot recommend this film to anyone but the most masochistic viewers. Avoid it like the plague if you want horror. You might find some enjoyment in watching it if you're a C-movie buff but not otherwise. I often found myself laughing but it was laughing at the movie and actors not with them. Maybe I missed the whole point and it is not intended to be a horror movie at all but a comedy on pair with ""Not another teen movie"" and the likes but if that is the case there were 3 of us in the room that missed the point. A very small + for the alien suits which looked quite good, but you cannot base a movie on 10 seconds of rubber suits.",Performance,Directional Techniques,
"the reviews of this film unfairly marginalize it for lack of realism. Did they scoff at, say, ""Fight Club"" for such reasons? It's far more unique and interesting for its cache of Depression-era lore and its assumptions about the dispossessed. Highly recommended for its bizarre mix of creepiness and homiletic. Obviously allegorical, it nevertheless fails -i think somehow deliberately - in being uplifting and points instead to something sinister in the crippled, maimed and poverty-stricken denizens of the city. The blind accordionist who attaches himself to Atwill wears glasses which are half black, half clear. His speeches are absurdly virtuous cliché, which belie his mendacious appearance in a very unconvincing way. I also noticed the back of the envelope calculations Atwill makes when pitching his stock market club for beggars only involved impossible amounts: millions in months. A lot of ticker tape shenanigans go on in the second half of the film, all of which are so exaggerated, I ended up thinking public anxiety about the market was also being channeled here quite volubly, along with fear of the disabled and wretched poor.

"I was disappointed when I saw this movie in 1954, probably because I was expecting more ""ancient Egypt stuff."" What we got was a pretty slow-moving, completely predictable romance. I just watched it again and it hasn't improved. Originally, the location shots were probably interesting; I would still like to see the actual places. However, by now, the sites are very familiar. It's really a '50s potboiler with a big budget. But I was right the first time. Robert Taylor was wooden; Eleanor Parker, pretty; Victor Jory's face was covered but we were treated to his wonderful voice. Taylor was much better in ""Camille"" when he but a sprig of a lad, but very sincere. Of course, the Egyptians were stereotyped according to the Hollywood vision of the time. Making Parker's husband the villain-fortune hunter was a bit much.",Plot,Performance,
"Let me be clear here first of all: I'm in my twenties, and I saw Bratz, but not for any kind of simple lewd intentions at gawking at sexy teens in gobs of make-up and slutty clothes. My intentions were a little more pure, on a movie-geek level. Or rather, I went in with the expectation that it *would* be a bad movie, and even one that would go to such ridiculous lengths as to be awesomely bad, to the level of something like Ghost Rider, where taking it seriously would provide brain damage, and by not would give some form of entertainment (especially if you have friends to make jokes with during the movie, which for something like Bratz isn't inappropriate to 'ruin' for the rest of the audience). It's a staggering, warped view of high school life, the connections made in 'cliques' and social order, and about the bonding between girls who can't get enough of talking to each other through their web-cams. It also has enough montages to kill a few horses, Jon Voight with not only a prosthetic nose but a statue of his head with the same fake nose, a fluffy dog who gets beauty treatment along with her owner, a mariachi band that lives at the house of the Hispanic girl of the Bratz (and, for some reason, this doesn't seem too out of place, especially when they show up at talent shows), and...Jesus, did I mention the montages?<br /><br />But for all of this, if one is in the right frame of mind, it's hilarious, even achingly and hysterically, funny material, whether it was intentional or not. Frankly, I'm sure that the filmmakers didn't quite know what they were doing outside of making a big long commercial with the intellectual value of Tropicana fruit punch. But on those levels it almost works at times at looking like an unintentional satire; what is one to make of the symbolism of the heightened security at the high school envisioned by the school emblem and trophies: a hand holding an ax, with little figures holding the axes all over the school in one form or another? It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer-leading, one science, and one journalism/singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one-note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16.<br /><br />Maybe if you're already quite a young girl, seeing this movie might not matter too much in the grand scheme of things as far as real psychological impact. But at the same time if one were to look objectively, Bratz's message is a little scrambled and quite off in any positive aspect. Does one stick with friends or act individualist or, um, like, go into another clique or another table? How about staying fashionable, in the glammed up style that the girls go to lengths to do- leading up to, of course, the Bratz mobile that they walk out of to the climactic talent show- even in the face of peril? It really doesn't serve any artistic integral purpose whatsoever either. So, in the end, it works best as a so-bad-it's-still-bad-but-uproarious treat for those who gorge on works that slip by in pop culture that are so sapped with the vigor of commercialism that to read through the mixed messages would take a pot of coffee and a fine-toothed comb. But along the way, it's got montages, and songs, LOTS of songs- which are, as one might imagine who doesn't listen to Radio Disney, the worst trash possible right now. Brattitude!!",Plot,,
"I enjoy watching the stars of this movie in their other projects so I really wanted to like this movie. I especially liked Billy Bob Thornton in ""School for Scoundrels"" so hoped this was a lot of more of similar humor as 2 ""enemies"" try to one up each other. I believed that due to the previews which play up the humor and conflict between the two characters.<br /><br />Wow, the actual movie is sadly different. The slapstick humor from the previews is noticeably missing and instead there are only a few laughs. Most of those come from Amy Poehler or Ethan Suplee. John Farley (Sean William Scott) just comes across as mean and unlikeable. Jasper Woodcock (Thornton) is dry and unfunny and through various scenes appears to be a person deserving pity almost. Beverly Farley (Susan Sarandon) is similarly sad as her tale unfolds. Rather than the light hearted slapstick comedy I was expecting, I got more of a dark comedy such as War of the Roses. This did not work even as well as that movie, which I also disliked.<br /><br />To have such a great cast, it is just really sad that this was the movie was they made. I am happy that I did not see it in the theater so I did not lose nearly as much money. This is definitely one I recommend people pass by, or better yet, watch the previews and imagine what you think the movie was. I wish I could do that.",Performance,Plot,
"Oh dear. I watched this film because a colleague recommended it. I will have serious words with her next time I see her. Here's why...<br /><br />A good film can be let down by a moment in the film when you, the viewer, don't believe (or buy) the characters' decisions or actions. This happened in The Wrestler, when the main character 'forgot' to attend the dinner date that he had managed to arrange with his estranged daughter. However, I would say on balance that The Wrestler is a good film, as other aspects of the film compensated for this 'moment'.<br /><br />Right At Your Door, on the other hand is literally riddled with moments which made me question the characters' actions and decisions to the point that I was saying out loud, phrases beginning with ""Why did he just...?"" or ""Why doesn't she...?"" This kind of spoilt the viewing experience for me.<br /><br />Also, I can't say that on balance, in spite of these numerous confusing/irritating moments, that RAYD is a good film. As many have said, the idea is good, but the script is really weak. The 'twist' at the end of the film left me furious. I really did feel like I had wasted 90 minutes of my life. I wanted all the characters to die of the poison - along with anyone who had anything to do with the relaxation of this cinematic sludge.<br /><br />And yet, there are people and critics who rate this film quite highly. Perhaps you should see it for yourself, but by no means do that under my recommendation.",Plot,,
"This film has a couple of shortcomings with plot, particularly the neat ending, and there seemed to be some difficulty with the continuity of locations (the family house, for instance). However, it is definitely worth watching for the performances. Tracy McMahon plays a small role at the beginning of the movie with utter conviction, flawlessly transforming from confident undergrad to crushed patient in a classroom demonstration. Andy Garcia is convincing as the haunted psychologist and superb as the grieving father, so much so that it makes for hard viewing. There's no greater pain than the loss of one's child, and Garcia conveys this with heartrending conviction. Not a film to watch alone if you have ever lost a child.",Performance,,
"Having seen Sur mes levres and liked it a lot, and having read reviews of this one that made it sound even better, I had high expectations.<br /><br />Alas, my initial disappointment with the opening scenes was confirmed as the film went on. I couldn't believe a single character except the father's mistress, Christine, played by Emmanuelle Devos, who made the film live for the two brief scenes in which she appeared. The first of those was quite early on, and I thought that the film was going to pull itself together and turn into something really good; but she disappeared then until another short scene quite close to the end.<br /><br />I found Romain Duris' performance tedious. He was not bad at the gangster bits, I suppose; but as a classical pianist, he was embarrassing to watch. To be fair, the character was just not credible -- you can't think of becoming a concert pianist if you are 28 years old and haven't practised for 10 years -- but all the swaying and drooping and bellows of anguish were so ridiculous that at times I had difficulty continuing to watch.<br /><br />I have no idea what point the director thought he was trying to make, and I don't think he had much of an idea either. Was he showing that it was possible to change, or that it was not?<br /><br />A complete waste of time, unfortunately. I just wish there were more films around with Emanuelle Devos. For an awkward woman with no real beauty, she has a presence and a power of attraction that are hard to withstand -- and I for one would have no wish to withstand them even if I could.",Performance,Music,

Then one sister decides she wants to be High Priestess after one day in the coven, using a magic spell to kill the lesbian HPs that's been hitting on her the whole weekend(she learns fast, eh?).

Romola also takes a striking turn in the lead as the sensitive, wiser, but younger sister. I most enjoyed Tara Fitzgerald's , quiet performance and thought it quite exceptional. She should have received award recognition for it. Rose Byrne, one of the exciting new actresses to come on the scene, is very effective as the slightly self-centered, dramatic older sister. Henry Thomas also turns in a very sensitive performance.

"I don't know why 'Dennis' only receives a 4.7 rating on IMDb because it is a rather enjoyable film with plenty of cute/funny moments that leave you chuckling so surely deserves a few points more. Based on the comic book and Eighties cartoon, this film centres on five-year-old Dennis, a boisterous little boy who just wants to help but everything he touches turns into a catastrophe. He hero-worships his miserable next-door neighbour Mr Wilson despite the old grump being the sort who thinks children should be seen and not heard. The main storyline is about a thieving hobo Switchblade Sam who has turned up in Dennis' town to make a picking except he hasn't counted on a certain blond-haired moppet making his life a misery!<br /><br />Mason Gamble was just so adorable as Dennis, giving a very engaging and energetic performance that leaves kids wanting to be his friend and adults wanting to adopt him. He's the sort of child who is cute but charming enough to not be just another cutesy Hollywood brat. Walter Mathau was also perfectly cast as the cantankerous Mr Wilson who just doesn't have time for small children and he has a very nice rapport with Joan Plowright, who played the exasperated Mrs Wilson. I also have to mention Christopher Lloyd as he is totally unrecognisable as the filthy, slimy Switchblade Sam and how he is just hilarious as the hardened thief who quickly regrets ever meeting Dennis.<br /><br />In many ways, this film is more involving and enjoyable than similar films such as 'Home Alone' since Dennis is a very sweet, likable character compared with the more cocky and, at times, grating Kevin. There is also few sugary, overly-sentimental moments that often crop up in family films. It would have been nice to see more of interactions between Mr Wilson and Dennis since that was always a great focal point of the cartoon series but this film is still a worthy successor. It should keep fans of the cartoon amused as well as thrill young kids who may not have ever heard of Dennis before now.",Plot,Performance,

"Watching `Predator', which is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movies, it becomes obvious why Arnold's recent return to action (`End of Days', `The Sixth Day) have all tanked at the box office. For some reason, Arnold's chosen to play men with a dark past in his recent films, men with a complex background . . . men with laughably bad backstories. His great characters - such as Dutch Schaeffer in `Predator' - have no background. It's not necessary. The second Arnold steps onscreen, you know it's time for blood and bullets, plain and simple. Not every moviegoers' cup of tea, to be sure, but it works. Unlike `End of Days' or `The Sixth Day', classic Schwarzenegger action films like `Predator' never insult the audience by attempting to explain the often threadbare plot. Predator is kind of a Zen-philosophy action film - the violence and cheesy one-liners just happen.<br /><br />`Predator' is a fairly simple story; it's essentially a sci-fi version of `The Most Dangerous Game.' A group of American soldiers, led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and his rival Dillon (Carl Weathers), lead a full-blown assault on a group of South American revolutionaries. Carnage ensues. After wiping out said revolutionaries, an alien creature armed to the teeth with high-powered weaponry - the Predator - assaults the American soldiers. More carnage ensues.<br /><br />Hey, it's not exactly Shakespeare, but thoughtful, well-written action movies aren't exactly common. `Predator' works as an action movie - and as a darn good one - because it's kept simple (thus minimizing the plot holes and the head-scratching moments), it maintains a high level of excitement, action, and tension, and it's cool. Schwarzenegger is larger than life as Dutch, pure swaggering testosterone at its best. Jesse `The Body' rules as Blaine, Carl Weathers is icily cool as Dillon. . . and so on and so on. Enough sarcastic, macho one-liners and brutal firepower fill the movie to make it a male adolescent snapshot of tough-guy heaven. The Predator looks wicked as well - Stan Winston outdid himself, as the Predator does look and move like a vicious being from another world, and not just some stunt guy in a rubber suit. The direction by John McTiernan adds the final piece to the puzzle; the cinematography of the jungle is appropriately hot, steamy, and claustrophobic, and the quick pacing of the film moves rapid fire between all-out action and the tension of hunting one's prey . . . or being hunted. Everything adds up to a simple, streamlined, first-rate action movie.<br /><br />Again, not the most intelligent film ever made, but `Predator' is still quite good - it's probably Schwarzenegger's best pure action movie. (Not his best movie overall, though; that honor belongs to the excellent `Kindergarten Cop'.) `Predator' is a lean, mean, intense action flick from start to finish. <br /><br />Grade: B",Directional Techniques,Performance,Plot

"Forgive me if I am wrong but there was something just plain missing from THE RUNESTONE, one of about three Viking Horror idiom films where ancient Viking curses lead to modern day havoc and mayhem. I was able to track down this one and a movie called THE BERSERKER, which won the contest easily by being a silly, sleazy, lurid backwoods hacker. This movie thinks it is HIGHLANDER material, and for the second time in a week I get to fault a horror movie from the late 80s/early 90s for not being sleazy enough. I am not sure when the era of ""respectable"" medium budget horror started (right after CREEPSHOW 2, maybe) but it resulted in a decades worth of uninteresting no-scares and no-offense meant horror efforts. The whole point of making a horror film is to give a young filmmaker the freedom to be as offensive as they see fit. Real talent doesn't come from disciplining yourself at first, it comes from letting it all hang out and RUNESTONE seemed to have a preoccupation with being respectable. <br /><br />The monster was cool though: At some point the film switches gears, transforming itself from a DA VINCI CODE-esquire thriller about ancient artifacts, manuscripts, talismans and glowering white haired Swedes into a busy, loud and amusingly obnoxious monster movie. Here we get to see Norse god of war Odin personified by a big rubber costumed goon with glowing eyes, cloven hoofs and a head peaked by a tangle of horns. If only the film hadn't exhausted my ability to understand what the point of it was by then. The gore is ultra low-key, the nudity and sexual content more suggested and non male gaze oriented than usual, and the hero was difficult to care about. The only real sparks in the film that registered in my brain were scenes where ""Resevoir Dogs'"" Lawrence Tierney gets to chew the scenery as a loud mouth clam-headed police captain between various killings, none of which inspired much dread, alarm or interest to be memorable.<br /><br />The HIGHLANDER comparisons come because the bulk of the film is set in New York City and involves large, open-spaced townhouses that are so expensive to rent that the only people who can afford to make use of them are set designers for movies. And the use of medieval weapons like broadswords, battle axes and a good icy glare from beneath hooded eyebrows. Seeing Alexander Gudanov dressed up like a Nordic Thomas Dolby to battle this costume designer's vision of Odin didn't provide much of a payoff, and the tail end of the film is filled with so many collapsing townhouse floors that the movie became a sort of ironic commentary on, yes, the 9/11 WTC tower collapse, caused by the weakening of the support girders and the pankcaking floors falling one on top of the other. I didn't see any puffs of dust but am pretty sure that these floors collapsed due to a controlled demolition so 9/11 Truth conspiracy buffs might want to check this film out to help your ""research"" into proving that Bush blew up the towers. And if all else fails you can post screengrabs of Odin with his eyes all glowing real demonic like and claim that they are non-doctored pictures of Condoleeza Rice. <br /><br />I think the bottom line here is that horror movies in general took a nose dive during the 1990s due to this frenzied rush to not offend anyone, which may explain why the sleazy Euro Horror years of the 1970s have proved to be so popular now on retrospect. RUNESTONE created nothing new, accomplished nothing notable and is probably only remembered by the scattershot few who bothered renting it as a home video release and perhaps yearn for the good old days when you could go out & rent three movies for $5.00 on a weeknight, watch them safe and secure knowing that your life with not be changed by any of them, there will be three more just like it to check out the following night, there will be no reason to ever watch any of them ever again, and your girlfriend won't be put off by gratuitous exploitational nudity or gross icky gore.

When a helicopter crashes, for example, you only see the the tail after the explosion. Where's the rest of the wreck?? I usually think that Liam Neeson is a good and interesting actor, but in this one he acts like he's on his first audition ever.

"The role of the paranoid-mystic and abused soldier Wozzeck is a perfect character for Klaus Kinski. Herzog is right not to interfere too much with this portrayal (and Kinski is in almost every shot) by simply setting up the camera and standing back. Kinski is typically intense, but he manages to glaze this with a perpetual preoccupation with something else, something as if off-camera.<br /><br />The problem is, there's nothing off-camera. The script is very close from Buchner's play but nothing in Herzog's production reflects it. There is none of the expressionism suggested by the DVD cover/advertising poster. The general look of the production is period-realist and close-framed. The action jumps, unmoderated, from one scene to the next, often losing a sense of dramatic causality. Herzog's strict adherence to the text eschews the opportunities afforded by film and left me feeling rather bereft...<br /><br />The crisp, document-realism of this film has only one sequence modulated with music - the one addition that could really transform it. Clearly, a production of Berg's opera on the same material has music built into it (and what music!) and, notably, music inbetween the scenes, providing the breadth and rumination that Herzog has stubbornly refused. It's a satisfactory reproduction of Buchner's text but, Kinski aside, not much more than that. 4/10",Performance,Music,
"At the start, you think that this is going to be a Western with a sense of humor. The latter quickly gets replaced with lots of Peckinpaugh-like bloodshed with a few in-jokes and a smattering of very black humor. Kasdan's direction and writing is too clever by half, and his characters too one-note and wooden. Even Jeff Goldblum is robbed of any humorous affects. Kevin Costner started earning his ""wooden"" reputation on this one, and Berenger is relentless. The plotline is internally inconsistent. Only Linda Hunt provides this mess's saving graces with a magnificent turn as a Pirate-Jenny-of-the West. Overall, one of the most disappointing westerns I have ever sat through.",Performance,,
"My father's family left a small island off the Donegal Coast early in the 20th Century and this film gave us a wonderful insight into life on such an island.<br /><br />The reality of the film really made it for us, the soda bread (or scone bread) as we called it on the table, the turf fires and the whitewashed walls. Even the seal colony is like Inishtrahull Island where our Dad was from.<br /><br />I recommend this film without hesitation if you have any roots or interest in Ireland.<br /><br />One blooper we noted in the subtitles. A kid is being teased for speaking Irish at the start (the film clearly shows why the language was so damaged in the early 20th Century and who was to blame).<br /><br />His fellow pupils are shown in the subtitles as saying ""Eject, Eject"" when of course they are actually shouting ""Eeejit"", the word Idiot in an Irish accent!.<br /><br />One other blooper we noted in the subtitles was a complete misinterpretation of Killybegs, a fishing port in Donegal which was titled something completely different.",Others,,
"This is coming from a NZ'er, so I've seen a fair bit of films from this country in my time, saying that, most of them have completely bored me, or irritated me. <br /><br />However, I was so very pleasantly surprised with Hidden, I was impressed with how good they managed to make the film on as I would suspect a low budget, of course having the scenery is a bonus.<br /><br />Another thing as well, most of the actors I had never heard of before, I think it might have been only two people from shortland street (wow!). Which in my opinion was very surprising. Both people acted very superficial and professional. <br /><br />I was astounded at the storyline, the whole plot kept me captivated because I had absolutely NO idea what was going on, the characters were special in one way or another, you got to understand them well and sympathize if they got hurt or died. <br /><br />Some even gave me the creeps, the guy with the sore lip especially confused me, when I saw him do the whole act around the tree part I was thinking ""oh no, he's going to end up an alien, just like that movie where the woman loses her son and everything's a mystery and suddenly there's people jumping through ceilings."" But I soon realized it was nothing like that, and it had a much more appealing twist to it. <br /><br />One thing that worried me was there was barely no communication with the group of campers, but in the end it didn't bother me because just their actions, the close-up's of the girls faces, the expressions, it was incredibly masterful and artistic. It was like a new kind of interaction.<br /><br />I loved this movie, the odd feeling of confusion it gave me at the end, that almost uncomfortable sensation, it's wonderful when a film makes you feel so much.<br /><br />Whoever compared this to the Blair witch project must have been on crack, and I am bewildered to the fact it has such a low rating.

"Film Noir at its best and Bogy better than his best that I've ever seen. Certainly this vehicle gives him play to develop his moods and attitudes which served him so well when it came time for him to work as Captain Queeg in ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954). A much more than cameo appearance by Basil Rathbone's Dr. Watson, meaning Nigel Bruce, adds to the country-bumpkin rural nature of the plot. Alexis Smith is elegant while Barbara Stanwyck exudes just the right combination of believability to carry off a difficult role brilliantly. One will readily recognize actress Isobel Elsom from her later, excellent roles in ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Love Is A Many Splendored Thing"". This is a Bogart masterpiece which, until after you've seen it, will leave you with a deficient attitude towards Bogart's greatness as one of the most versatile actors Hollywood ever produced.",Directional Techniques,Performance,
"This afternoon at the Barbican, I attended the UK premiere of the digitally restored 'The Story of the Kelly Gang', with excellent piano accompaniment by John Sweeney, as part of the opening day's programme for the Silent Film & Live Music Series running through June. It's also part of the London Australian Film Festival, likewise at the Barbican ... so, I actually ended up attending two film festivals simultaneously! The restored film is a double-bill with 'The Life Story of John Lee: The Man They Could Not Hang'.<br /><br />'The Story of the Kelly Gang' is generally believed to be (and most likely WAS) the first feature-length movie ever made, produced in 1906. Sadly, the past tense is appropriate here, as the film is now not known to survive except in fragments ... and some of those do indeed appear to be out-takes, as a previous IMDb'er has noted. Actually, I've also seen (in Australia) another reel of this film: not a projection of the movie's image onto a screen, but rather I've seen (and touched) a mouldering reel of nitrate footage from the movie itself, now deteriorated beyond hope of restoration.<br /><br />As a part-time Australian (born in Scotland, expatriated Down Under as a 'child migrant'), I ought to feel proud that Australia produced the first feature movie. However, quite enough films pre-dating 1906 survive (from various nations) to make it clear that a substantial amount of film technique -- the close-up, the dissolve, the cross-cut -- had already evolved before this movie was made. Watching this restoration at the Barbican, it occurred to me that credit for the single biggest innovation in 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' belongs not to the photographer, director, editor or scenarist, but rather to that most unsung of film figures ... old Smokey, the projectionist. Prior to 'The Story of the Kelly Gang', films were so short that it was possible to store two or more separate movies on one projection reel. And, each reel being a separate story, the breaks between reels were natural breaks in the narrative. Many early cinemas had only one projector, with live entertainment provided during the longeur while the previous reel was rewound before the next reel could be shown. However, when 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' was exhibited in its original form in Australia (and later in other countries), the projectionist had to maintain two sets of apparatus at the same go, so as to achieve a seamless transition between reels. I wonder how soon film editors began using a reel marker (traditionally in the frame's upper right-hand corner) to indicate that a reel was about to end.<br /><br />Despite being largely missing in action, the original 'Story of the Kelly Gang' is of incalculable historic importance. As for the digital version which I enjoyed today, accompanied by Mr Sweeney's impressive performance on the keyboard, I'll rate it a full 10 out of 10. Bonzer, cobbers!",Directional Techniques,,
"You don't have to be Nostradamus to predict a sequel to the original and creepy film by Tom Holland was inevitable. The soul of a psycho-killer inside a doll was a big hit at the box-office and you know what that means...More from the same!! And fast! But hey, who's complaining? Child's Play 2 is fairly good. Some nice twists, several funny moments and a few very original killings. What more could you ask for in a horror sequel? Story doesn't matter. In fact, can you call this a story ? Chucky comes back to life and continues to chase Andy to take over his soul. He has to kill everyone who comes too close to him and his secret and every time he's about to call Dumballah ( or whatever ), he gets interrupted. Voilà, there you have the plot of Child's Play 2. Original ? No. Entertaining ? Yes, very. Jenny Agutter plays the role of Andy's foster mom. I tell you, she still is as adorable as when she played her role in American Werewolf in London...only older, of course. Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky and he seems to enjoy that very much. That's about all there is to say about Child's Play 2. Certainly not a ""urgently need-to-see movie"" but pure fun if you come across it on TV or something. It's recommended to watch the first two films in a row. Child's Play 3, however, should be avoided like the plague...yuk. The more recent Bride of Chucky uses a whole other style, but surely is worth a look.

"I bought this film on DVD in a local secondhand DVD shop,ours being region 2,i was surprised that you can not get this on region 1 area or region 0 which a lot of modern dvds are now,i suppose if you really look around you will find them.I thought the film was very good for 1954,the photography was good,the horse riding scenes on the cliffs were exciting,and the music was good,it was subtle and gradually built up to a climax,but never became to intense,the film was quite atmospheric almost as if you were with them,the directing was clever.the characters were interesting,five very different types of people all brought together.However i think i am the only female so far to wright a comment on this film ,and my point of view may differ.What i see is that the female character is acting in a very paranoid and agitated way ,and is trying to distance her self from them,which is how you would react if you were a woman travelling with four men you don't know,to her the enemies may not just be the Indian's in the mountains.The scene in where she is riding her horse and she looks round because she can hear Hooker and Friske laughing,believing it must be about her, says it all.I mean ,every time she makes a move to go anywhere one of them follows her,i don't think it has occurred to them that she may just want to go to the toilet,the only ulterior motive i can see her having is get me out of this uncomfortable situation,thats why she wanted to stay behind and stoke the fire,she was probably thinking give me some space.A good intriguing film any way.",Directional Techniques,,

"The lost language of cranes"" is a British TV movie based on the novel by David Leavitt. The problem when you see a movie adaptation of a book you have already read -- and loved -- is that either the adaptation is not faithful and betrays the book, or it is too faithful and just looks like a summary of the story. Very rarely a movie adaptation can remain faithful to the essence of the book but not so literal that it brings nothing new to the story; unfortunately, that's the case here.<br /><br />It tells the story of a family, the Benjamins, who have lots of secrets. Owen Benjamin, played by Brian Cox, is a closeted homosexual married to Rose (Eileen Atkins). Every Sunday Owen goes to a porno cinema, where he has anonymous sex with men. Owen and Rose's son, Philip (Angus MacFadyen), is also a gay man, but he has no problems with his sexuality. He's very much in love with Elliot (Corey Parker), a young American artist who was raised by a gay couple. The conflict starts when Philip decides to come out to his parents, making his father face his own desire and his mother confront her own prejudice.<br /><br />The most surprising fact about this British adaptation of an American novel is how little the change of place from New York to London affects the story. Indeed, this adaptation is so faithful to the original that whole dialogs from the book appear on the screen, almost unchanged. And yet, we get to know from the bonus interviews on this DVD that the porno cinema, which plays such an important role in the story, was a real problem in the adaptation because there were no such places in London, due to their laws. So apparently the screenwriter, Sean Mathias, had to ""create"" a porno cinema that never existed, appropriately called ""the Fantasy"".<br /><br />Among the sacrifices that had to be made for the sake of the length of the movie, the one I most regret is the use of the character Jerene, played by Cathy Tyson. In the novel, Jerene is a full and complex character, a black lesbian student who was rejected by her parents and develops a thesis about languages that are lost forever, like the little boy who, neglected by his mother, learned to communicate looking at the cranes from his window. In the movie, Jerene appears only to explain the title of the film and little else.<br /><br />If you haven't read the novel, you will find this movie a very interesting drama about a family having to face their hidden secrets, but without ever raising their voices, which is very British! If you already know the book, however, you may feel a little disappointed.",Performance,Directional Techniques,

This plot (or similar) has been done so many times before that is't tiresome and boring in and of itself. There are two types of movies that I swear from this day forth I will never waste my time watching again. One is the plot where a high school or college basketball coach is enlisted to rejuvenate a losing team, and the other is one in which a CEO or other high level person has their family kidnapped for some kind of favor. We've seen all of these we need.

It was a mess of things that didn't make any sense, characters as plot devices, and terribly unfunny one-liners. Oh, the one-liners. They were so cringe-worthy. At one point, Hellboy says the phrase ""your royal ass-ness!"" to Prince Nuada as if it's some sort of witty insult, rather than something that nobody has said since fifth grade.<br /><br />Also, Seth McFarlane as mechanical-suit-man was incredibly distracting because his voice, with the German accent, sounded exactly like Klauss... the fish from American Dad.<br /><br />None of the plot developments made any sense in the context of the story; they were only there to serve the writers' ends and seemed terribly contrived and unrealistic.

I mean, really. Prince Nuada was the only one who was like, ""uhh.. something's not right here. oh right, we're living in a f*cking SEWER!""

It is hard to conceive how our good Lord could share the throne of the world with Devil but human relationships are always understandable. The characters in the movie mentioned a word love' a couple of times but whatever it was in the end the kind of relationship those two people had in the course of the movie gives a clear indication that it was not love even at the beginning - that was all what the bare lust can produce and you could still cheer yourself up with catching the flashes of the seductive Salma's body.

Perhaps my disappointment in the film was based on faulty expectations. It's just a B picture from Columbia, clearly made on a shoestring budget, and what comedy there is in the film is pretty forced and obvious, exemplified by a tedious gag in which Brian Aherne has trouble opening a door. The plot -- a couple move into a building where a murderer lives -- was more entertaining when the Three Stooges did it. Even the solution to the mystery is forgettable. Young and Aherne are okay, but have nowhere near the chemistry of William Powell and Myrna Loy in their many films together.

People being sent to another dimension, finding a derelict ship or something, and coming back to have a monster pop out of one of their bodies? There's even a Smartgun from Aliens appearing in a couple of scenes (""I'm gonna go and get 'the gun'""). The entire movie moves slow and doesn't make much sense either. The sets are boring as are the characters and the dialogue. The monster looked kind of interesting at first, but when they finally showed it in its entirety it looked like a model with crappy lighting. This is sincerely the worst movie I have ever seen to date.",Plot,Visual Effect,
"Without being driven by my emotions for SRK(whom I really admire), I think Saawariya is a much much better movie than OSO - I hate comparing them but that seems to be the way people want to judge it.Saawariya is definitely SLB's best work , is breathtakingly beautiful and has wonderful acting which confuses me because inspite of all this it tends to get boring.<br /><br />It is a love story about an effervescent,full of life Ranbir and a serene,sad Sonam waiting for her lover to return.Meanwhile the two strike a friendship - but one of them expects more from it which makes for the rest of the movie. The movie has some great music and a few brilliant scenes but there are scenes that simply annoyed me.I couldn't make sense of it,the dialogues were pathetic(ex the Lilypop-Ranbir scenes) etc.Also the fact that the movie doesn't find grounding in reality - we don't know the place or time may not appeal to people who are not much into love stories and music.<br /><br />Ranbir Kapoor is awesome.He has a charm and a skill (a Lee Strasberg product)that makes us want to see more of him.Sonam is brilliant inspite of having such a weakly written character that you feel like loving and hating as well.Rani is a show stealer but her significance to the plot is questionable and Salman is just there!<br /><br />My advice would be don't watch either OSO or Saawariya - wait for a DVD to come out.Instead go check out Jab We Met which is definitely the best movie to come out this year.",Plot,Performance,
"I caught this film on cable the other night, and I totally mystified me.<br /><br />Los Angeles in 1972 was one of the most influential periods in the history of rock music. The Eagles, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt and the best session people in the country were located here. David Geffen was starting Asylum records. Tom Waits was playing in the local clubs. They ended up dominating the 70's in both critical acclaim and record sales. That would make an interesting movie.<br /><br />Or if you wanted to make a film about groupies and English rockers (who wouldn't be playing at the Whiskey for crying out loud) then why not make a film about Rodney Bingenheimer's English Acid where cute underage Valley girls hooked up with stoned out limey superstars. Again - the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />Unfortunately the makers of Sunset Strip decided to make a somewhat racy version of Love American Style - complete with the kinds of characters and clothes that would have fit easily in a Barnaby Jones episode from the time. They could have easily set the film in today's Hollywood and then at least the film might have been more marketable, and the retro music might have made more sense. (The film's English superstar band sounded a lot more like the Psychedelic Furs then Led Zeppelin.)<br /><br />One more thing - the only film I want to see that features the clap in a prominent role is something for ninth grade health class or the the Fatty Arbuckle story.",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"This was a ridiculous version of male hustlers and other assorted homeless teens because it is done in such a clean-cut manner. I assume that the people that drifter teen Johnny encounter during his stay in Las Vegas would be much more hostile, crazy, and the like. If you're not looking for a vigorous story of similar circumstances like say, 'Where the Day Takes You,' then Speedway Junky is a good weening toy. <br /><br />The story is that of a recent high school dropout, Johnny, who's Southern accent miraculously comes and go. Upset with his military father's strict manner of upbringing, and perhaps lack of affection (I don't see how, really, or at least they never make much of Johnny's perceived 'abuses' and 'neglect' evident), he decides to hitchhike his way to North Carolina to be none other than a member of Richard Petty's stock car racing team. If you know incredulous Hollywood movies, then you should already expect Johnny to go through a lot of crap, but some how wind up with a happy ending in the end.<br /><br />Johnny gets robbed of his twenty-bucks worth of quarters from a Casino. The rest of his things are taken by a horny middle-aged pimp with a penchant for boys in leather collars. So Johnny is stuck. Luckily, he befriends a group of street kids. Namely, Eric (played nicely by Jordan Brower), the kid who helps Johnny out the most when it seem many others won't. He also introduces him to the life of hustling, stolen cars, and the like. And Johnny, though successful at times, still seems like a major amateur. A ridiculously comical one at that. <br /><br />Enter Steve, played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who interestingly enough replaced Balthazar Ghetty in the role (Ghetty plays a similar character in 'Where the Day Takes You' only less dehumanized). Steve is like the professional teen hustler, who'll do anything his clients ask as long as he gets paid. Johnny and Eric get into serious trouble when Steven steals another kid's stash of drugs and money, and he isn't the kind of kid you just say sorry to and then treat to ice cream. <br /><br />Eric is the more interesting character. A gay young man, he likes Johnny, but is consistently obsessed with the idea that maybe Johnny isn't going to carry on the deep friendship Eric imagines simply because Johnny is straight. Johnny is kind of an obnoxious character, despite being the main presence in the movie. He is the nice guy, the charming guy, but in the end, still a hopeless doofus. <br /><br />The rest of the characters, too, are simply comical caricatures with what seems like no reality in there that would entice the viewer to form emotional connections with or somehow empathize or whatever. We learn no lessons from this movie either, which I suppose is inherent in movies like these, that you should walk away with something. Why would they spend so much time on the story and dramatic elements and character development (or lack thereof) as a result? There's a reason for all of that. Only here, it doesn't work. Johnny is a moron and for that, I really found it hard to appreciate whatever stupid dilemma he got himself into. One after the other. Steve, too, though a disgusting character, is hardly real. Nothing happens to him. He just floats in and out of the scenes to remind you of a villainous presence. And the ending was just corny as hell.<br /><br />I'd stick with 'Where the Day Takes You' if this is the kind of movie you desire. Or, at least see it for Brower's performance.",Performance,Plot,
"I have to say that, for a long time, I didn't even bother watching any of the two ""Goal!"" movies because of my bad experiences with a few other soccer movies I've seen in the past. However, last week I happened to stumble upon the first movie while it was shown on TV and I kinda liked it, giving it an IMDb rating of 8 out of 10 stars. Although it was definitely not an excellent movie, having a few plot holes and a quite predictable ending, it was still a surprisingly good soccer movie with an otherwise decent plot. Logically, I wanted to see the sequel and therefore decided to rent it on DVD a few days later.<br /><br />However, the second ""Goal!"" movie was a huge disappointment. It was nothing but another below-average soccer movie with a boring and predictable plot. While the beginning was more or less promising, the rest of the movie was just a bunch of nonsense. It wasn't even about soccer anymore. Throughout the movie, the scenes of a soccer match would only occasionally appear on screen for a few minutes, while the rest was about disco clubs, parties, expensive cars, love affairs, family problems, paparazzi, filming of TV commercials... All in all, a bunch of more or less uninteresting situations already seen in numerous movies about famous musicians or film stars.<br /><br />The ending was also as predictable as it gets, with the main character's new club, Real Madrid, winning the Champions League in a similar fashion as his previous club, Newcastle United, qualified for the Champions League in the first movie, coming back from 2-0 down to win the game 3-2 in the final few minutes. I rated this movie 3 out of 10 stars, but the rating could have easily been lower. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen in the last few months. One more thing, it was quite unusual to see another sequel being announced at the end of such a terrible movie. I'm not sure if I'm going to give it a try, it surely can't be much better than this.",Plot,,

"This silent 1927 masterpiece is truly brilliant. To me it embodies everything that cinema is meant to be; it's visual art in motion, literature with pictures, history with emotion; all those and much more. It really is at the peak of film-making.<br /><br />I say that, but that is not to say it is a perfect film. Just that the intention in creating this bleak and powerful look at poverty in early 20th-century Russia is absolutely spot-on: It wants to tell a tale, create an image, and to breathe life into history. The intention is not simply to entertain like so many awful films of the past ten years, which is a good thing, since ""The End of St. Petersberg"" is great without actually being entertaining.<br /><br />There are some very powerful scenes and some frankly unforgettable visual sequences - the scenes of the first world war for example, or the beginning of the workers' strike. Take it from me, Pudovkin's direction is absolutely masterful and I think it's sad that seemingly so few people have discovered him. But with all that said, by today's standards this doesn't quite have the staying power of Chaplin or Keaton.<br /><br />It's quite wonderful to behold, but it can really only captivate the interest of people who are interested in details of history, or who know little of the events leading up to the Russian revolution. Unfortunately for me I'm neither very interested nor entirely ignorant and so while I'm very glad to have witnessed this grand-scale piece of master craftsmanship it couldn't completely peak my interest.<br /><br />That's unimportant though in the great scheme of things, and I don't mean to say that I don't thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys film or art. ****1/2 / *****",Visual Effect,,
"Director-star Orson Welles also adapted Isak Dinesen's rather pointless book about an aged millionaire recluse living in China who tells his employee of an incredible story he heard while in the service regarding a rich, dying man, his terrible wife and a sailor-stud. The employee explains that this tale is just a legend, but the millionaire aims to make it fact. The sexual implications in the narrative aren't ignored by Welles, though they are tip-toed around (probably due to the restrictions of 1968), and when Welles as the ""old gentleman"" finds himself the perfect boy to complete his plan, it's hard not to smirk when he calls the bottle-blonde ""a fine looking sailor"" and then offers him money.

"Everybody is here admiring the movie and you know what??? This movie deserves that.<br /><br />Some say its following Company, some user even said Hooda is made up to look like Devgan in Company. W-T-F ?? Some so-called (they call themselves) RGV fans have given comments earlier about the movie which are only distracting the RGV fans (may be they will review Ramu's Sarkar in the same way), I request them not to do this and go for traditional Bollywwod masala flicks. <br /><br />I am also a fan of RGV and I have compared all his gangster movies with this one and felt finally that this one is a completely independent one. May be it's based upon Dawood Ibrahim's life which the viewer shouldn't care about, the story is well and realistically said. Chunkey Pandey has done a very good job. Randeep Hooda looks very talented delivering a cool performance. Especially his dialogue delivery (I loved his so called monotonous voice), body language were nice. Watch his next release ""Risk"" directed by Sawant and you will feel his voice. I loved the dialogue muting style. We can also find this style in Ramu's Sarkar and Sawant's Risk.<br /><br />As Vishram Sawant, a former photographer, is the director of this movie; you can see high quality photography in every frame. The camera angles, lighting are creative and simple, not dramatic and loud. Supporting actors and the set, props are very supportive. No doubt Yaspal Sharma and Sushant Singh gave great performance as bad guys, but Zakir Hussain who is also as talented as them is in a small role as Babban. The narration by Markand Despande is touching with slight humorous as the same one of Company and Satya. All characters are made with own personality which is not found in typical Bollywood films.<br /><br />The only thing I skip while watching this movie is the song ""Khudko maar daala re"" which is a signature of RGV production. May be this is also signature of Vishram Sawant as his following ""Risk"" also contains a same unwanted number. <br /><br />At last this movie is not for spending a lazy afternoon, but a collectible one for RGV fans.

"I found this film extremely well done for several reasons I will nominate.<br /><br />It debates some moral issues, how far is it acceptable for a society still full of consevative people, such as the one performed by Hugh Grant, to acept a relationship such as that of the main characters? It is totally at the border of normality (meaning normality not necessarily what's good but what's common). The film also touches strongly the theme of hipocrisie (probably wrong spelled, this word.) once more in the character of Hugh Grant who, despite showing all the time disgut and repugnace for the story he is being told, is always secretly desiring and wanting something equivalent to happen to him (this hipocratic attitude may be the result of growing up in a world and a society where this kind of sexual liberties and practices are repressed and in here once more we are taken to atrong moral issues which take us to rethink the whole thing...).<br /><br />Apart from this questions this film makes me also think about the relationships between men and women... Is there an everlasting love? or at least an everlasting relationship?... Suddendly I recalled Schopenhauer who claimed that no man could be happy with only one woman... maybe this film is showing that he was right... the pace of the relationship between Mimi and the writer was so high that they just emptied all there possibilities very soon, but if we put that at the scale of a normal marriage, aren't all the possibilities also tried at the end of 10 20 or 30 years? Can a marriage last happy for both till ""death tears them apart"" ?...<br /><br />Besides this few topics of discussion (to which I could add some more if I just remembered them right now) I found this film very well directed with some beautiful scenes... also some strongs scenes that stay with us... Excelent performances for the three leading roles... Kristin Scott Thomas is also good in here but not so as in other films also because her somewhat small part in this one didn't allow her to show more than she did. This film proves once more Roman Polansky as one of the greatest directors of our times, since he shows he is totally in control of every detail of direction (I enjoyed the increase of the speed together with the increase of intensity of the relationship among the couple). Good dialogues but specially excelent speeches of the writer whenever he becomes the narrator which is often... Also an excelent note for the soundtrack by Vangelis and other well known songs which appear along. A must see.",Directional Techniques,Visual Effect,

She wakes-up in the woods with a psychopath (Eric Colvin), fighting to survive for more than forty days and asking information about her daughter to the stranger.<br /><br />""Broken"" is a sick, unpleasant and disturbing low budget movie. In spite of having a reference in the beginning of the movie that it is based on a true event, the pointless story is completely flawed, the character of Hope is a total idiot and the schoolgirl is very stupid and annoying. There is no explanation about where they are and how the women have been kidnapped and transported to the middle of nowhere; Hope is an imbecile, and I do not understand how her character does not kill the sadistic maniac when she has the chance and after being tortured the way she had been; the schoolgirl screaming all the time is really irritating, provoking the nasty situation with her tongue.

Randolph Scott does nothing to detract from the picture. Certainly no more than Chuck Connors does in the same role in Move Over Darling. The courtroom scenes with Grant and Granville Bates as the judge are superior, and Donald McBride as the hotel clerk is exceptional.

First, Mary tries out for the school play and then she tries to get into the final concert of everyone's favorite band, Sidarthur. In the end, Mary gets everything she wants because she is the so-called ""protagonist"" of the movie. Lohan plays this part amazingly well, mostly because Lohan is a drama-driven slut in real life. That's just my opinion, but I know that a lot of people agree with me. Mary is just about as horrible a role model for young girls as there is. Just as bad as a lot of mean girl antagonists like Carla or Sharpay from High School Musical, if not worse, a lot worse. This is a very bad movie to show your daughters because it gives them horrible impressions about appropriate behavior for girls and it teaches them completely horrendous values about life and getting what you want.

"The Last Mimzy doesn't pander needlessly to its core audience, but at the same time it also has a good accomplishment in that it also has an appeal to adults, or at least those that have passed that age of adolescence and look back on childhood with levels of nostalgia and relief that it's over. It delights as well as gives special meaning to putting a level of belief in what is unknown at a time when the rest of the world relies on hard facts and rigid control of personality. It also puts ET to a certain test: can the little creature from another world that needs to get home kind of story hold up to quasi (actually precise) psychedelia? Pink Floyd shirts and Roger Waters aside, this may even have a secret appeal to stoners just as much as your little boy or girl at the movie theater, who will obviously see it in a different life, that of light, efficient irreverence and lots of neat special effects.<br /><br />'Mimzy' tells the story of a boy and a girl, Noah and Emma, both at least under the age of 10 but old enough to be articulate enough as well as appropriately secretive in the fantasy they hold paramount, who come upon a strange rock from the ocean. In it lies a bunch of fragments, and, oddly enough, a stuffed, fluffy, cute bunny named Mimzy, who Emma takes as her most important possession. Noah meanwhile becomes transfixed with the new powers that soon come to him via these rocks: he can hear the smallest insect, and is transfixed by obscure designs. This strikes up the attention of his parents as well as his science teacher (Rainn Wilson), who also knows of the symbols Noah makes up. But after a power outage- it also happens to be a generator that Noah conjures- gets the attention of the government, not sure what exactly is going on. Emma has a problem, however, in that Mimzy, her closest confidant and ""teacher"" is dying and needs to get back home. That's the basic story, anyway, as there are little ins and outs as the story goes on, including a great product placement for Sprite, and a montage-free example of each child's new abilities.<br /><br />Some of this may be a little preposterous, even goofy, but Bob Shaye and his team bypass the obvious but still perilous pit-falls for filmmakers investing themselves into children's movies. No truly stupid gags, nothing with bodily excretions, none of that really, and if anything the humor, of a little wild and over-the-top in variety (some of which I was laughing at alone while the other kids were silent), is innocent and sort of knowing of the split of imagination between children and adults. The two kids are also very good at playing their parts, with Wryn as Emma very adept at being vulnerable and smart, and O'Neil being almost too close to looking like the boy Elliot in ET, however not without his own strengths. Shaye sometimes lets his control slip in just simple things like cinematography or making a fitting enough ending (too many futuristic hippies me thinks), and the goofiness does teeter on becoming a little too much. But I responded more to how the power of taking a long repeated idea, of kids becoming changed by outside forces in a very real world, and there being a sort of little twist to it all. It's not just about making friends and gaining in some alien intelligence, but in figuring the significance of the future, however weird it might be. It's definitely the finest children's movie, non-animated, to come out so far in 2007. 7.5/10",Plot,Performance,

"When one thinks of the best school based films this gem is often overlooked in favour of well known American films which is a shame as Gregory's Girl is just as good. It certainly has a very British feel to it, Gregory plays in the school's football team which has lost every match of their season, instead of shouting at the team the coach wearily holds a try out for new players. The only person trying out who is any good is Dorothy... the coach doesn't want a girl on the team but reluctantly lets her join as he really has nothing to lose. As soon as he sees her play Gregory falls in love with her and sets about getting a date with her.<br /><br />John Gordon Sinclair does a great job as awkward teenager Gregory and there is a fine supporting cast including Dee Hepburn as Dorothy, Clare Grogan as Susan, a friend of Dorothy's who likes Gregory and young Allison Forster who, in her only acting role, was delightful as Gregory's sister Madeline. It helps that the main actors aren't in their mid-twenties and the school is clearly populated by children.<br /><br />While the main plot is obviously about Gregory there are also plenty of other interesting characters including two boys who work for the school magazine who make money selling photographs of Dorothy in an unofficial shop they've set up in the boys' toilets, here we also see Gregory's brother selling assorted pastries and various boys having a smoke. Even though there are lots of surreal moments this film seems to be one of the most realistic portrayals of a school; the children all seem like real school children, at least from a British perspective. We don't have the standard group of cliques we would get in a US school drama and nobody really cares that the football team is useless.<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody wanting a good laugh and a fairly accurate depiction of life at a British School.",Plot,Performance,
"I saw this film when it came out in 1984, and since then, have been unable to forget it. I have been looking for it everywhere, from shops to the Internet without success. It seemed to have disappeared from the surface of the Earth. Finally, ARTE, a French/German TV channel, decided to broadcast it two months ago...and of course, I recorded it. It is based around a very simple storyline. A chess match. The two main players in the world. Both russians. Two generations fighting against each other, and also two visions of the world. The oldest generation who stayed and endured the last 50 years of Russian history. The younger one who left, but not unscathed. For them, only one thing matters : Chess, but for the outside world, and their entourage, many other things come into account: propaganda, money etc...

"Woody Allen's sex comedy hasn't been well received, and that's a shame because it's actually quite good; one of Woody's funniest films, in fact.<br /><br />The film starts off with a segment called ""Do Aphrodisiacs really work?"", and it is without doubt the best segment of the film. It features Woody at his neurotic, comic best and keeps itself alive with an almost constant stream of giggles. After this, the film never reaches that high again, and some of the tales are rather hit and miss. The segment involving Gene Wilder falling in love with a sheep is one such miss - on one hand, it's surreal and the idea is sort of funny; but it's only an idea and the lack of gags means that it fails to generate any real laughs (and that's what the film is going for - laughs). There's a couple of other misses; the euro-style sex short is one (it's good in idea, but poor in execution) and similarly the game show; ""What's my perversion"" is surreal, and again kind of funny; but it never really goes for the money shot (another bad pun, I'm sorry) and that makes it unsatisfying on the whole. However, when it works, it really works!<br /><br />As I've mentioned, the first segment is the best; but Woody's sexual take on the classic B-movies of the 50's isn't far behind at all. Imagine it; Woody Allen being chased by a giant...tit. It sounds great and it is; the scene where Woody goes into a police station to report it is hilarious. The transvestite segment borders between hit and miss, but it's a hit on the whole; it's one of those sketches that has you cringing and the only thing you can do is laugh, and it works because of that. The sketch that this film will be best remembered for is, of course, the sperm sequence, which is both hugely inventive and surreally funny. I knew of this sequence before watching the film, and I was afraid that Woody might not have been able to carry it off, but now I really don't know what I was worried about; Woody is, like in the first sequence, at his best in the scene. He plays...a sperm. His musings in this role are hilarious, in a way that only Woody can be; and overall this is one of the funniest scenes of the movie.<br /><br />As I said; the sketches are hit and miss, and some of the sketches fail to penetrate, but overall this film is a big hit for me. The humour is very juvenile, and it wont appeal to some of the more mature fans of cinema; but this film should be appreciated for what it is; a real good time. Even the sketches that do miss the mark are more than funny enough to carry the film on, and this film therefore comes with a huge recommendation to anyone that enjoys this brand of silly humour.",Performance,Plot,
"A simple thriller like so many others. A car accident, two orphans sheltered by the parents' business associates who are revealed to have been the killers to put their hands on the money the children represent, and all that for some shady business with criminal contractors. Banal. The elder child, the girl, will try to escape and will fail. And little by little things are going down but all is well that ends well and I can't reveal the details, except that the uncle will get the kids he should have gotten from the very start since he was the only family.

Since it was Mother's Day we all decided to go see this film. Since she is the artist in our group, we thought she would enjoy it. To sum it up, after about 20 minutes, she kept lighting up her watch to see what time it was. We stayed to the end of the film (which seemed an eternity) but just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. It didn't seem to understand where it was going and spun entirely out of control the last half of the film. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worse enemy.

Carpenter, Spencer Charters, Tom Chatterton, Richard Cramer, Jim Farley, Thurston Hall, Robert Homans, Vera Lewis, Milton Kibbee, Lilian Lawrence, Pat O'Malley, Henry Otho, Francis Sayles, Guy Wikerson....Director Michael Curtiz, Screenplay Robert Buckner.<br /><br />The year 1939 was a big year for movies (Gone With The Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Goodbye Mr. Chips) and this ""Old West"" film from director Michael Curtiz was but one of two of his films that were in theaters that year to great acclaim; the other being Private Lives of Elizabeth And Essex with Bette Davis. Errol Flynn had achieved Hollywood stardom with ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" opposite Olivia De Havilland, who was herself emerging as an actress. Hollywood at the onset of World War II was enamored of Flynn and De Havilland and they starred in various films together. In ""Dodge City"", we find ourselves in Kansas, 1866, right after the Civil War has ended. The small cattle town of Dodge City is a lawless, dangerous and unhappy place, controlled by a corrupt Sheriff (Bruce Cabot). It's up to our hero Errol Flynn (as Wade Hatton) to turn things around and save the day. Olivia De Havilland portrays his love interest, Abbie Irving, a beautiful and resourceful prairie-born-and-bred girl whose brother Joe (Frank McHugh) is reckless and is eventually killed by Wade. This puts a damper on the relationship between Wade and Abbie but after she takes a job as newspaper writer and spends more time with Wade, the two fall in love. Before long, the bad guy/guyss are defeated and Wade becomes the town's new mayor. This film is possibly bland and predictable next to other Westerns that have stood the test of time (Giant, Hondo, How The West Was Won) but it has some good aspects and was a beloved Western in its day. Filmed in Technicolor at a time when it was rare to see films in color, the cinematography (by Sol Polito who worked for Warner Bros and for Curtiz's films is very beautiful, owing to the fact it was filmed outdoors in Kansas-like landscapes and realistic-looking sets. The music is by Max Steiner, who worked like crazy on dozens of films for Warner Bros. This film represents a kind of flower of the Hollywood studio system, as far as Westerns. Errol Flynn is superb, Olivia De Havilland is lovely and there is enough action (train and stagecoach race, bar fights, gun duels, etc) to perfectly fit into a classic, high-calibre Western. If you enjoy Errol Flynn (he did his own stunts at a time when no one did) and Olivia De Havilland, this film is highly enjoyable. But despite the historic setting, you will not learn much about post-Civil War America. In fact, the whole thing suffers from stereotypes of the Old West: the vulgar but good-hearted saloon girl, the good cowboy vs the evil sheriff, etc. This is a film that was meant to take you back to the Old West purely for entertainment.",Plot,Performance,
"I suspect there are several cuts of this doco doing the rounds. The copy I saw focused heavily on Joe's erotic films and referred to his horror output in passing. There are numerous X-rated films presented in their X-rated glory and EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA'S legendary ""snuff"" footage (the breasts being cut off) is given generous screen time.<br /><br />The interviews with the highly likable Joe are informative and candid. He is an unassuming, articulate gent and discusses his interest in shocking audiences, why he wanted to mix erotica with horror, and how he may have been responsible for one of his performers turning gay.<br /><br />His friendship and working relationship with Indonesian beauty Laura Gemser is touched on, as is his indifferent attitude to shooting hardcore.<br /><br />Joe D'Amato personifies an incredible period in Continental cinema that has now passed. It is great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his fine, unique work.<br /><br />RIP, Joe.",Directional Techniques,,
"I woke up early, turned on the T.V. flipped to TMC just as this movie was showing opening credits. Happy Accident! I loved it! Yeah, the plot was hokey and melodramatic, but as a whole the movie was very charming. It was a ""moment"" filled movie. Lot's of scenes and dialogue that was original, and fun. Like a scene where Bill,Lily, and the Peg-Leg guy are planting seeds in the garden. Or Bill's Tag line ""Have a chew on me"". It was made in 1931, so they were able to get away with all sorts of lines that would not have been included had the movie been made a few years later, after the code was established. For instance Bill's waitress girlfriend commenting to a customer, ""I'm APO, Ain't Puttin' Out"". Hee! I always find those pre-code ""Talking"" films interesting. The films that existed before people got bent out of shape about the things you could and could not say, do, or insinuate in a movie. Definitely a fun and entertaining viewing. Even more fun when you realize a good portion of the things they were saying wouldn't be allowed in movies again until the 1960's.",Plot,,

"**WARNING - SPOILERS** Prof. John Koestler (Cage), gets his mitts on a piece of paper with a long sequence of numbers on it that  to cut a long story short - predicts the end of the world. As one probably would in these situations, Koestler sets out to try to prove this to anyone who will listen in a desperate attempt to save mankind. Meanwhile Koestler's son starts to see strange blond people skulking about in the woods around their house.<br /><br />This movie had my eyes glued to the screen until the last 20 minutes or so. It was interesting, scary, disturbing and I couldn't wait to see what happened next. My movie snacks lay forgotten, the plot had me hooked. The plane crash sequence frightened the hell out of me and so did the story and Koestler started to uncover more of the mystery surrounding the final numbers. even the ridiculous blond people were eerie. Then the movie started to draw to a close and I opened a bag Maltesers to counter-balance my disappointment.<br /><br />I found the sequences leading to the end predictable and ridiculous, and I think the scene with the children reaching their new home was out of place and unnecessary. I would have been happy just to leave that part to the imagination and watch earth's spectacular doom on its own. Their departure could have been concluded the same way without the scene. Their new home has an Eden-like vibe to it, complete with all-too-immaculate CGI scenery and a big shiny tree. It kinda reminded me of a shampoo commercial for some reason. I also thought that if the aliens/angels had taken that much trouble to make sure that the human race would continue elsewhere, they would not have just dumped these kids somewhere on their own and left them to their own devices, free to make all the same horrendous mistakes we humans seem to be all too proficient at. Maybe I am just skeptical, but I see a 'Lord of the Flies' type situation developing very quickly in this new place.<br /><br />Despite this I was impressed with the subsequent ending scenes, set apart from many apocalyptic movies churned out by Hollywood. Aside from the few children and white rabbits the aliens/angels whisked away, no one and nothing is spared, and the desperation and despair of those who remain, along with the destruction of E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G is impressive. It makes a change from the typical ending where the resourceful and virtuous heroes crawl out from their clever hiding places to cry and clutch each other joyfully before skipping off to rebuild their shattered lives.<br /><br />I give this movie 7 out of 10 - Silly and predictable towards the end (""please don't let it be aliens, please don't let it be aliens. . . awww, damn - it's aliens""), but also thought provoking and disturbing. Nicholas Cage is better than I have seen him in a while.",Plot,Performance,
"It seems likely that the only thing getting 'The Breed' off the shelves is the lure of it's young cast, and in particular, its co-stars Michelle Rodgriguez and Oliver Reed. Or, at least it might suffice, as the random date movie title for younger viewers. For all else, The Breed, is little more than a template horror movie that, although has the rare incentive of decent acting, offers extremely limited thrills or even decent writing.<br /><br />The story centers on a group of friends--two of them being brothers--who return to their uncle's old cabin on some forested island, unaware that it is infested with a pack of vicious dogs that have either contracted a furious case of rabies or have escaped a genetic experiment (the writers seem to have a hard time deciding on which they'd rather go with, despite the stupidity in character's reasoning for the former). And that is essentially what the eighty some minutes of screen time boils down to--escaping the dogs.

By the end of the movie, my wife and I were on the edge of our seats. We later found out that my wife's boss had the exact same experience.<br /><br />I'd love to see the movie again, but it seems that the slow first part of this movie has turned so many people off that few people have seen the whole thing, and therefore, there's virtually no demand for this nail-biting, on-the-edge-or-your-seat story.",Others,,
"This was an excellent pirate movie and was better than many sound pirate films. However, it's really hard to rate the movie---compared to other silent pirate films, it might just be the best. But, compared to THE SEA HAWK, CAPTAIN BLOOD or THE BLACK SWAN (all wonderful sound pirate films from the 30s and 40s), it isn't as good a film.<br /><br />So what does the movie do that worked so well for me? First, being a Douglas Fairbanks film, it had wonderful stunts and impeccable production values--something he was known for in his silent films. Second, this film had excellent sets and was the best film money could buy in its day. In fact, it was such a lavish production that it was supposedly the first full-length film made in 2-color Technicolor--an early and somewhat crude way of producing a color movie. Because the film was dyed with green-blue and orange-red dyes, the film mostly looks reddish-green--definitely NOT true color. But, it doesn't look that bad--certainly much better than the horrid colorized films destroyed in the 1980s. Plus, if it hadn't been for films like this, the infinitely better 3-color system might never have been developed by Technicolor. And, finally, the plot is pretty good for a silent film--not the most complex when compared to later films, it's not nearly as simplistic as most other silents.<br /><br />This video was produced by KINO FILMS. Some of their silent films in the past were less than wonderful (especially some of their Buster Keaton videotapes), but this videotape is top quality and has nice extras at the end of the tape. Some cheaper prints apparently are only black and white, not color. Nice job for the restoration, KINO! However, despite what the video box said, it was apparently NOT the first full-length two-color Technicolor film. I recently saw a restored print from TOLL OF THE SEA (1922) and it was in fact made using this process four years earlier than THE BLACK PIRATE.",Directional Techniques,Performance,

Not especially revealing about Hollywood, which at this stage wasn't quite ready to unmask itself, but still engaging and intriguing. Douglas is well-cast (he spits out his lines with a terse jaw--nothing new--but he's right for this part and is commendable).

Uninspired, unoriginal, guys is rubber masks and so on. Come on.

"Let me begin by saying that there are precious few movies that can actually scare the crap out of you, and this is one of them. The tension that this movie generates is overwhelming at times, and if you watch it with someone who's never seen it before, be sure to keep your eye on them. You'll probably notice a look of disbelief on their unsuspecting face.<br /><br />Anyone who doesn't like being scared will end up being unable to finish this movie. People who have a taste for the brutally bizarre will probably hit play again after the credits roll. In light of all this, I must also say that in some respects, TCM's bark is much worse than it's bite. Being banned in so many countries for so long, and having a title that includes the phrase 'Chainsaw Massacre', has seemingly led many people to believe that there is an undue amount of gore in it. However, there simply isn't. Gore is not where the scares are in this one. The scares come from the absolutely brutal and bizarre scenarios that befall poor Sally Hardesty.<br /><br />In closing, I'd also like to go out on a limb and make the following grandiose statement: TCM is the greatest horror film of all time!

"Rob Zombie's theatrical directing debut ""House of 1000 Corpses"" has often been sold as wacky horror comedy. But it's everything else than that.<br /><br />Zombie does a good job with making the viewer feel save in the first half of the movie. The first scene could have been right out of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" or one of its countless rip-offs: Two people having a funny conversation and it all ends in a blood bath. Been there, done that more than once. Then your typical teen-horror characters get introduced. All of them more annoying than likable. And so the movie goes on and you are pretty sure that nothing too interesting will happen anymore. WRONG! Suddenly Rob Zombie shifts gear and what started as an average teenie-slasher, becomes a twisted and frightening piece of unexpected terror. And I mean REALLY unexpected, not just ""creative killings"". You can't tell what happens next, especially not in the last act.<br /><br />Many viewers have complained about the ""Video clip style"" of the movie. Well, I can see that it might be annoying for some viewers, but it also adds a surreal quality to the movie. The whole thing looks and feels like a nightmare! Colours change from normal to screaming, people say things that don't make any sense, you see crazy pictures, everything you might have witnessed in a dream is in that movie!

"The Jayhawkers maybe unique in the annals of screen history in that as a film with a Civil War era plot it makes absolutely no mention of slavery. Nor are there any black people in this cast.<br /><br />What we have here in ante-bellum Kansas is the story of Luke Darcy who envisions himself as starting some kind of fascistic territorial republic in the struggle for Kansas's loyalty. Jeff Chandler plays Darcy and he is a fascinatingly evil man with a great deal of charisma. <br /><br />To bring him down military governor Herbert Rudley uses ex-renegade raider Fess Parker. Parker and Chandler have a history and it involves Parker's late wife who Chandler ran off with and abandoned. <br /><br />Parker's got ample reason to just shoot him down like a dog, but Rudley wants him alive to stand trial. Complicating things further is Nicole Maurey and her two kids who Parker's fallen for and then Chandler takes an interest when he sees her. <br /><br />The story does get a bit silly at times, but the players are all doing their best. Henry Silva plays one of Chandler's raiders who has an incredible jealousy of Parker and a barely disguised gay crush on Chandler. <br /><br />Jerome Moross wrote the music score and it's lively and quickens the pace of this film. Fans of the Wagon Train series will recognize parts of the score as Wagon Train's theme. <br /><br />The story of Kansas before the Civil War, usually with John Brown as the protagonist has supplied the cinema with a whole range of films.

"If ""The Killing Time"" is ranked well below average, this is mainly due to its implausibility and inconsistency. I could enumerate lots of reasons why the scenario is totally incredulous, but simply describing how the film starts, will suffice: A stranger (Sutherland) kills a man who was on his way to a job as a deputy sheriff in a small California coastal town. The murderer subsequently goes to the town, assuming the killed man's identity and starting to work in the police precinct himself, without anyone noticing that there is something wrong! The sequel of events does not get any more plausible: We watch the existing deputy sheriff Sam Wayborn (Bridges), as he plans along with his girlfriend Laura Winslow (Kath), the murder of her husband Jake (Rogers), with the intent of putting the blame on his new colleague. Throughout this inconsistent story we experience lots of annoying plot gaps, which render the movie a rather boring experience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the direction does not help either. I do not know the other works of director Rick King, but I bet this is not his best one...<br /><br />The same goes with the acting: With the exception of Kiefer Sutherland, who manages to inject some liveliness in his role as a psycho stranger, the rest of the cast is mired in mediocrity.<br /><br />Quite disappointing. 3/10.",Plot,,

"I will admit I had been looking forward to checking out this film for a while now. Hearing stuff about how it was a great character based drama in a post-9/11 New York City and how it really held meaning and was a catharsis for those who watched. Just the fact that it was a serious dramatic turn for director Danny Leiner, yes he of Harold and Kumar fame, was enough to pique my interest. In the end, however, the film really fell flat for me and besides the numerous references to the horrific event, The Great New Wonderful didn't need to have it as a backdrop. Sure there are some really nice moments, but overall it just shows stories of vapid people going through their meaningless existences until they finally let go from the tragedy that hit. Are we to believe that once the shock went away these people's lives changed for the better? that without 9/11 they would still be trapped in useless existences not being able to break free? Well if that is the case, than we need global tragedies more often because they really make the world think about life and become better people as a result. Maybe one needs to be a New Yorker to get the film, but I just didn't see the greatness, just exploitation about how the Twin Towers falling changed a few people in the city and made their lives understandable in its context because they weren't good enough people to see their wrongs without it.<br /><br />We are given an all-star cast here, with many actors that I truly enjoy watching. They even do a pretty good job with what they are given, and I can't really fault any of them besides the fact they read the script and still wanted to be involved. Maggie Gyllenhaal is great as a cake designer discovering the utter uselessness of her job in a world that should mean more than five thousand dollar pastries. Judy Greer and Thomas McCarthy are fantastic as a husband and wife duo trying to survive professional and personal hardship while their troubled child devolves into a monster. This segment is interesting as a concept and I would almost like to see it as its own movie. I mean besides a racial slur from their son, the entire story has nothing to do with 9/11 at all, but just an emotional piece of family struggle. Even Jim Gaffigan surprises with his nuanced performance opposite Tony Shalhoub. The rapport between the two is electric and could have really gone somewhere instead of languishing in an awkwardly comedic setting, ending somewhat laughably with Shalhoub's sly smile into the camera.<br /><br />Thankfully there are a couple moments that worked completely for me. Olympia Dukakis is amazing as a wife who has been creatively and emotionally stifled by her husband and monotonous existence. Only when she meets an old friend from the past and sees how he can laugh and care about the little things in life, does she open up to herself to try again at living her life the way she wants to. The best section of the film, however, contains two Indian bodyguards protecting a General in town for a run of speeches. Sharat Saxena is effective as the troubled one suppressing his anger with everything that has gone on, but it is his partner, played by Naseeruddin Shah who steals the show. A consummate family man, Shah does all he can to lighten the mood of his friend and just speaks about random things going on around them, flirting with the women going in and out of their paths and finally confronting Saxena to get the point across that ""life is too short, if anything we should all know that now."" The conclusion of their arc really hits home in a surprising turn of events and becomes the only reason I would recommend the film to anyone to see.",Plot,Directional Techniques,

"Summary: Four strangers with dreams of success meet in a train to Mumbai from Allahabad. Bobby (Dino Morea), Omi (Rohit Roy), Jai (Bikram Saluja) and Lucky (Sanjay Suri) land in Mumbai and don't know what to do. One day, they decide to make big money and circumstances lead them to kidnapping Musa (Sanjay Dutt) who actually turns out to be a Don. The rest of the movie is a story of wasted talent, mindless bullets and wild dances.<br /><br />Comments: The story is absolutely weak with no substance. All we can see is that the boys understand the value of being at home and not exposing themselves to the dangers of their wild dreams. Dutt surely has performed well, but his Armani suits do not match with his profile of being a tough don. The four actors have done a fairly average job. The ladies in the movies didn't have much of role worth making a mention. The movie on the whole makes an average viewing.",Plot,Performance,
"Saw this movie on re-run just once, when I was about 13, in 1980. It completely matched my teenaged fantasies of sweet, gentle, interesting  and let's face it  hot  ""older"" guys. Just ordered it from CD Universe about a month ago, and have given it about four whirls in the two weeks since. As somebody mentioned  I'm haunted by it. As somebody else mentioned  I think it's part of a midlife crisis as well! Being 39 and realizing how much has changed since those simpler '70s times when girls of 13 actually did take buses and go to malls together and had a lot more freedom away from the confines of modern suburbia makes me sad for my daughter  who is nearly 13 herself. Thirteen back then was in many ways a lot more grown up.<br /><br />The film is definitely '70s but not in a super-dated cheesy way, in fact the outfits Denise Miller as Jessie wears could be current now! You know what they say, everything that goes around... although the short-short jogging shorts worn by Rex with the to-the-knees sweat socks probably won't make a comeback. <br /><br />The subject matter is handled in a very sensitive way and the characters are treated with a lot of respect. It's not the most chatty movie going  I often wished for more to be said between Jessie and Michael that would cement why he was also attracted to her. But the acting is solid, the movie is sweet and atmospheric, and the fringe characters give great performances. Mary Beth Manning as Jessie's friend Caroline is a total hoot  I think we all had friends like her. Maia Danziger as the relentless flirt with Michael gives a wiggy, stoned-out performance that just makes you laugh  because we also all knew girls that acted like that.<br /><br />Denise Miller knocked her performance out of the ballpark with a very down-to-earth quality likely credited to her uknown status and being new to the industry. And I think not a little of the credit for the film's theatre-grade quality comes from the very capable, brilliant hands of the story's authors, Carole and the late Bruce Hart, who also wrote for Sesame Street. They really cared about the message of the movie, which was not an overt in-your-face thing, while at the same time understanding how eager many girls are to grow up at that age.<br /><br />One thing that made me love the film then as much as now is not taking the cliché, easy, tied-with-a-bow but sort of let-down ending. In fact it's probably the end that has caused so many women to return to viewing the movie in their later years.<br /><br />Re-watching Sooner or Later has me absolutely sick with nostalgia for those simpler times, and has triggered a ridiculous and sudden obsession with catching up with Rex Smith  whom while I enjoyed his albums Sooner or Later and Forever when I was young, I never plastered his posters on my walls as I did some of my other faves. In the past week, I've put his music on my iPod, read fan sites, found interviews (and marveled in just how brilliant he really is  the man has a fascinating way of thinking), watched clips on YouTube  what am I, 13? I guess that's the biggest appeal of this movie. Remembering what it was like to be 13 and the whole world was ahead of you.",Performance,,
"This piece of trash is totally without merit. There are many inaccuracies about The Maid. I have extensive knowledge of her life, and this movie must be about someone else.

"Mississippi burning shows Gene Hackman at his best and at his side is Willem Dafoe who also plays very strong. Mississippi Burning is a dramatic movie made in 1988 directed by the talented Alan Parker (who has also directed Fame and Midnight Express). The lead roles are played by Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe and Frances McDorman is at her best playing a supporting role. The movie is based on the true story of the murder of three civil rights workers in 1964, so the movie is set in 1964 Mississippi.<br /><br />The movie begins with the three civil rights workers who are brutally murdered; the viewer now already knows that the police are involved. Allan Ward and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) are sent to Mississippi to shed some light on the case. The two agents have very different personalities, Rupert Anderson used to be a sheriff in a small Mississippi town, just like the town where they are investigating missing civil right workers, he does not like to do everything by the book, in contrary to Allan Ward, he is a hard working FBI agent who likes to do everything by the book. Not long after they enter the town they see that it will not be easy, the townspeople are very hostile towards them and the KKK is involved, Mr. Ward soon ask for more FBI agents, even when Mr. Anderson thinks it is a bad idea. Soon there are an enormous amount of FBI agents in the small town, but that only makes the townspeople angrier. The KKK set a church for black people on fire to scare the black people into not talking to the FBI, when Ward and Anderson walk into a restaurant and try talking to a black person he says: ''I have nothing to say to you'' but still the townspeople beat him up for talking to people from the FBI. The FBI agents search trough the endless swamps and find the car of the civil rights workers, but they still find no bodies. Agent Anderson feels a connection with the wife of the deputy sheriff and feels that she knows something but she won't tell anything. When Ward lets Anderson do it his way they finally see what really happened.<br /><br />The acting in Mississippi Burning is close to brilliant, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are both good actors, but together they are brilliant. Gene Hackman is born for the role of an old Mississippi sheriff who knows how it all works. Gene plays very dominant and the scene in the bar where he threatens the townspeople is one of the best moments in the movie, because you don't expect it from him but still it fits him very well. Frances McDorman plays the cop who does everything by the book excellent, even his appearance, the glasses and his pale skin. Especially the scene where Anderson beats someone up in the barber shop you see that this goes against his principles.<br /><br />The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal; there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''. The soundtrack is by Lannie Spann McBride, she made the very powerful song ''Walk On By Faith''. There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat. Also Kitty Wells and Mahalia Jackson have made songs for the movie which are all beautiful.<br /><br />This movie is a beautiful movie with a perfectly cast. The music is very well made and used. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are a perfect duo and should do more movies together, they fit the term '' good cop bad cop '' perfectly as Gene Hackman really does look as a hardened, bad cop and Dafoe as good cop. What they shouldn't have done was basing it on a real story, because clearly the director didn't want to be restrained, because a lot was different in the movie than what really happened, only a couple of things are historically correct, asides from that it's a must watch, I give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10, so a small 9 out of ten.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
"What a fantastic film. Having seen all of Kevin Smith's post Clerks productions, I was relentlessly pestered by my friends to watch this classic and having finally got hold of it, I must say it was a pleasant but not unusual surprise. I didn't really know what to expect other than it is in black and white and scripted by our beloved producer but what a hilarious film it turned out to be.<br /><br />The dialogue is typical Kevin Smith work, evident in his later films such as dogma and chasing amy, and might I add work that I thoroughly enjoy. The film was shot on a budget so don't expect anything fancy. No real big names although by now you should have heard of some of the actors.<br /><br />It will appear that this film is more appealing to Kevin Smith fans and not really for the faint hearted movie viewers who prefer clichés and typical dialogue (including them awful one liners). Oh no no no, this is one fast talking, twisted and very entertaining movie, but one that can only be appreciated when one can lower his/her inhibitions.<br /><br />Give it a shot, it's something different and if it's your cup of tea then you should love this movie, but if not then come back to it at a later date, you may actually appreciate this film at some point in your life!",Directional Techniques,,
"Have seen this film quite a few times and never tire of it as it is a brilliant depiction of the Arthurian legend and Camelot. The sets were fantastic and WHAT a cast! I've seen a lot of films that involve knights on horseback and guys fighting each other with swords dressed in armor but this is the only one with hugely over the top acting and way too out of this world grossly exaggerated dialog. Merlin, played by Nichol Williamson is incredible in this and put in one hell of a performance, much to the surprise of the directors who, as rumor had it, wanted to recast him!! Patrick Stewart puts that booming voice of his to good use too on more than one occasion!! This is by far the best film made in Ireland in the '80s. It also covered the story of King Arthur better than any other film before or since.",Directional Techniques,Performance,
"It's not a surprise that Luigi Cozzi, after this movie, never shot a film again (except for two documentaries). This thing is not worth being called a movie (I've directed better films with my friends). The attempt of the director to give the film a photography reminiscent of the chromatic games of Suspiria is simply pathetic, and is nonetheless the better thing of the movie. However this film made me laugh so much with my friends that I should forgive its uselessness and its ugliness. We had a lot of fun. There are two sequences in Paganini Horror (one at the beginning, the other close to the ending) so silly and dumb that you can't do nothing but laugh.. unfortunately the rest of the movie can be quietly trashed away, its boringness is something unbelievable (especially during the music scenes). Maybe this film owes its only appeal to the bad acting of the actors, the principal cause of hilarity. But even the script is wonderful: the invisible barrier is surely the lowest (or highest) moment of the film...",Directional Techniques,Music,Performance
"We're here! Where's my videophone? This movie is not as bad as some of the critics here say. It is reasonably entertaining, if you can get past the first 15 minutes. It is Tom Clancy, so there is some twists and turns to the plot, which keeps it interesting. I think it is best to compare it to some of the lamer James Bond movies; on that score it looks reasonably good.<br /><br />What was going through my mind as I watched it was that I bet the computer security folks have watched the movie as a warning of what could happen, sort of, if they don't do their job. And I bet some of the hackers watch it with dreams of glory.<br /><br />Obviously, the problems with the Internet described in the movie haven't happened, for the most part, so the movie looks a bit foolish. Actually, I see from the book review that while the novel was written in 1999, it was set in 2010. But we have been learning in the past year or so about the dangers of spyware that abound. In that sense, the premise was remarkably prescient. Corporations just love to get their hands on all sorts of information about you, without your knowledge. And the government is not so different; often they work hand in hand, as in the airline passenger data collection. So the movie, as science fiction, is not entirely far fetched.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Scott Bakula and his great work on Quanum Leap. Frankly, the TV show had better writing, not to mention better cinematography. And the critics who bemoan all the boilerplate about asschewing are right. Another point that bothers me, especially given Clancy's general penchant for veracity, is the absurdity of they guy's wife covering him on the news. No reputable news organization would allow this incest, except perhaps FOX.<br /><br />But the ending is interesting enough to make it all worthwhile.<br /><br />Fans of Ayn Rand should find this movie especially interesting. It follows the same theme as Rand McNally Shrugged. And the quality of writing is about equal. <br /><br />Who is Steve Day???",Performance,Directional Techniques,

"Hmmm, after reading the others' comments on ""Big Shot: Confessions of a Campus Bookie"", I am wondering if they really watched the same movie. Characters are the same, events are the same, even the silly cardboard cut-outs in the ""big game"" scene are the same.<br /><br />So why would these people take the time to write glowing reviews of a boringly predictable moral tale?<br /><br />Answer 1: Novices. Perhaps these people have never witnessed a ""moving picture"" before and are very impressed simply by the illusion of movement across large white screens (or glowing dots of light if they're watching on a television). Perhaps they have never experienced any of the thousands of children stories that show a protagonist doing something ethically questionable and then regretting it in the end (ie, ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"", ""King Midas"", ""The Godfather"", or any story involving getting wishes).<br /><br />Answer 2: Friends of the movie. Perhaps these people either worked on the movie or are somehow associated with people with interests in the movie.<br /><br />To keep with the movie's theme, I'm giving 3:2 odds on the latter.<br /><br />Okay, the review (skipping a summary as you can read that elsewhere): From the opening scene, the protagonist, Benny (ably played by Numb3rs' star David Krumholtz), tells us this is the story of how he came to regret his current state. This swift reveal also destroys much of the opportunity this movie had to keep us engaged. Instead of letting us discover what happens, we already know how it's going to turn out. There's a fourth act and a bizarre epilogue as well, but I'll get to that later.<br /><br />Benny's sidekicks are capably but predictably played as your basic NYC stereotypes. Benny's girlfriend is decently portrayed by ""House"" star Jennifer Morrison. The other bookies, bad-guys, and the basketball star (Tory Kittles) are again simple characters marking simple stereotypes. While better actors could have squeezed something out of the characters, there was clearly nothing in the script for them to work with.<br /><br />One interesting note is the excessive use of body-mounted cameras. These shots are used to portray various intense moods of Benny, but are so used that they get very annoying. Instead of hitting the same note on the piano, let the DP use other tricks, please. Other than that, the look and style was decent for an ultra-low budget film.<br /><br />But for a movie that indulges so much in the coarse pleasures of life (drugs, violence, strip-clubs, etc.), I am amazed at the lack of female eye-candy in this film. This is made especially more painful from the tease of the establishing sequence of why Benny chose to come to Arizona in the first place. Even the titty-bar shuns nudity (the girls are all wearing bikinis or silly-looking pasties). Sure, this was a made-for-TV movie, but it's already rated R. Truly sad is the decision to make an exploitation movie and not have any exploitation.<br /><br />While the occasional breaking of the fourth wall (where the Benny talks directly into the camera during a scene a la ""Malcolm in the Middle"") is amusing, the near constant use of voice-over narration to explain, re-explain, and re-re-explain the plot is not only overkill, it's downright insulting. I paused the movie eight times to cool down before I finally finished it. Had I been in a theater I would have simply walked out.<br /><br />And if the painfully clear moral of the film wasn't drop-dead obvious enough, after the out-of-no-where fourth act comes an epilogue. In this final bit, the real Benny Silverman talks directly to the audience (think ""Blow""), re-re-re-repeating the moral, insisting for the audience to never do what he did (what? and never get a movie made about your life?).<br /><br />It's like paying to hear a rich drug addict preach about not doing drugs. For me, the message is clear: I want my money back!",Directional Techniques,Performance,Plot
"Saw RINGU 2, along with RINGU on Saturday, August 2, 2003 and must say that I felt that both films were quite well done. However, I felt that the Hong kong import DVD that a friend had that I watched was quite inferior to an otherwise excellent film, for one thing, it was obviously cropped, and equally obvious that it was taken directly from a videotape, as you can hear the tell-tale whirring throughout the movie. to add to this, the subtitles were blurring and white with no dark outlines, which means whenever someone in white is in the scene he obliterates the subtitles, thus making it hard to follow the storyline. Otherwise, the film itself was well-done and logically follows the storyline. An interesting sidenote is the fact that there is one scene (The first visit to the hospital), which was recreated in the US version of the first film. While not as good as the original, I still recommend it, if you can find a better print of it on DVD.",Plot,Visual Effect,
"Apart from the even worse I DON'T WANT TO BE BORN (also starring the great Joan Collins), this is the absolute worst film she ever made (even worse than THE BITCH).

I'm sure that when Ms. Collins made it big on the show DYNASTY, she wanted to buy up every copy of these films, but they remain as a testament to just how low her career had sunk in the 1970s.<br /><br />EMPIRE OF THE ANTS is about a Realtor (Collins) trying to sell swampland to a group of tourists. Together, the entire cast looked like actors that couldn't quite make the cut to get on LOVE BOAT.

"In typical rock-em, sock-em Heston style, he battles the bad guys in a not to shabby, but now somewhat dated sci-fi adventure. Still, an excellent movie with a terrific premise, and great plot, as mankind is nearly destroyed by nuclear/biological warfare, and Heston struggles to survive as the last sane man in a diseased and dying world.<br /><br />Flashbacks of events leading to this disaster really make this movie come alive. A little melodrama, however is apparent in the scenes of ""the family"", and the movie does show its age with the language and color of the 70's culture.<br /><br />I'm not sure how some people may take the ending of this movie. I don't remember any big fuss about it in 1971, so I guess it won't be an issue now. A good movie, with a sad, yet hope-filled happy ending, this film is yet another feather-in-the-cap for Charlton Heston when he was in his sci-fi movie making period (Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green) in his great career, and this particular ""social statement"" movie of the 70's remains relevant to this day.",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"The problem with any belief (an abstract), dependent on faith (an abstract), is that no concrete evidence is provided. Choosing the belief of any cult, versus one's own belief, is a quandary. An atheist does not believe in any God, whether it be a cult's God or anyone else's concept (an abstract) of God. A concept (which, again, is an abstract) may be confusing or difficult to understand. An agnostic will not accept God, without concrete evidence, but faith-based religious and spiritual systems require an acceptance based on the abstract (such persons believe that their concept of God is rooted in a higher power). God is invisible. Yet, some say that they feel, hear and see God in the nature, the rain and the wind. But, what is the formula? This remains a mystery, in this film, because it is never completely revealed. And, will our world soon end?<br /><br />""Believers"" (2007) promotes critical analysis, divergent thinking, introspection, and reflection. Set in a dark, creepy and furtive realm, one can be hypnotized by the bewitching mood and musical score. In Myrick style, this film becomes a masterfully-crafted thriller, effectively supplying anxiety, fear, menace, suspense, and tension. The cult represented, in this film, seems to promote life. Yet, is there life within the shroud of the death scent of Hitler's control and manipulation, his experimentation, coercion, and force? <br /><br />The riveting performance by Daniel Benzali, who plays the Teacher, is at his insidious, evil best. His spellbinding, measured, and haunting tone of voice brilliantly captures the cult's intended mission, fails to reveal--until the end of the film--just how it will carry out. But, the actors and director are faithful to the script, and they do become masters of horror, without most of the blood and all of the gore. The film, beautifully counterbalanced and integrated, seems to show (at least on the surface) pratfalls of blind faith and misdirected trust. All people are born. All people will die. But, what is the eagerness for death, if we never have lived? <br /><br />Because the film asks questions that our finite minds are unable to answer, I rate this film an 8 out of 10.

"I remember watching it back in the 70's. Never missed an episode. Along with the exciting rescues, there were also some amusing situations. There was the call they got for a guy who got his big toe stuck in the tub faucet. Another was for a guy who was building a ship model and accidentally super-glued his hands to the model. He wouldn't let them cut the model from his hands, so they bring him into the hospital with the ship still attached to his hands as nautical music played in the background. Another was the one where they responded to a toilet on fire. When they arrived, they went to use their fire hose, but the hose caught on fire. Meanwhile, outside, a man threw a cigarette on a lawn where a sprinkler was going. The lawn caught fire. They figured out that the gas and water lines got crossed at a work site.<br /><br />But you could always count on a huge incident to climax each show. I seem to remember one episode where they were responding to a house fire, and while they were working that fire, a house across the street also caught fire. Another was a man who climbed out to the end of the crossarm of a 100 ft tall construction tower to commit suicide. He changed his mind, but then was afraid to move. <br /><br />When I heard about the new NBC show ""Trauma"", I was so hoping it would be much the same, however Trauma concentrated too much on the everyday lives of the characters and not enough on exciting rescues. Also, instead of the camaraderie and humor that the station 51 crew on Emergency had, Trauma's crew seemed to be conflicted and at odds with each other. The first episode of Trauma was the most exciting, but after that, things seemed to go downhill. I hear that Trauma has been canceled. I wish it would have worked. TV needs another show with the excitement and humor of Emergency!<br /><br />I just got the Season 1 DVD set! For the most part, it's great. There was one problem with disk 2, side 2, 2nd episode ""Publicity Hound"". When it got to the scene near the end when they are bringing the child up the ladder, it sticks then cuts out to the menu. There are only 4 scene selection options, the last starts before that rescue. The problem continued with the beginning of the 3rd episode, ""Wierd Wednesday"". After a bit of the beginning, it skipped to the opening credits.

It was a bad ship, and it ended in a one-way ticket back to Sweden, paid by the Swedish embassy, but, however, there were some Mexican hookers visiting our ship every day during our stay, very friendly and ""speakable"", but one day when they came aboard one of them shouted ""I'm a movie star"", and she explained that she had a part in a film called ""Crossroads"" (later I found out that it was called Back Roads), featuring Sally Field. As the years went by I looked for this film but never found it, until today(!) 14th March 2007, when they showed it on cable television...fantastic! After all, she wasn't lying!

"This is really one of the best movies I´ve ever watched in my life! Christopher Plummer is absolutely wonderful as Atahualpa (nice accent, convincing acting) and Robert Shaw is a great Francisco Pizarro (lots of emotion and passion). This movie is about a beautiful culture and empire being ruined within a very short time: the Spanish conquistadors come to Peru in search of gold and to convert the natives. They find an extremely well-organised empire with their own God: Atahualpa. It´s fascinating to watch Pizarro becoming more and more fond of Atahualpa and at the same time it becomes more and more difficult for Pizarro to decide about the Inca´s fate. This is, of course, not a very modern movie: there are no visual or audio effects and at certain points the camera work isn´t perfect (a bit shaky, for instance). However, the story is great, the dialogue is interesting and sometimes thoroughly moving and the actors are doing a terrific job! Full marks for The Royal Hunt Of The Sun and...sorry, but I have to mention it...Plummer doesn´t look bad in this movie...",Performance,Music,

"I first saw this film when my children were so small that they consumed my time and energy and things went in one head and out the other. All these years, all I could remember about it was that it was one of those on my list of Movies to See When Your Kids Let You Have Your Sanity Back. That made it particularly fun to watch again recently. Goldie's character is so beautifully understated. She is just one of us, going about her day, until her life changes. You can relate each step of the way. I loved how the camera caught pieces of the truth that she did not, slowly building suspense. This calm elegance perfectly complements John Heard is at his deliciously evil best. The score works beautifully with the plot. Definitely put this on your jump-off-the-couch list.",Plot,Music,Performance
"Hot rods and gila monsters! - now there's a mix that absolutely demands attention. ""The Giant Gila Monster"" opens ominously enough with sinister music but quickly turns into ""At the Hop"", at a pace that is repeated enough times in the movie to keep you off balance.<br /><br />It's difficult to get a fix on just how monstrous our title monster is in the early going, as frequent close ups of the creature merely reveal a rather normal lizard. As the film progresses, the creature seems to grow in stature, as when he's sized up against oncoming vehicles or when he manages to destroy a railroad trestle causing a train wreck. Presumably this beast was responsible for the disappearance of two teenagers and an oil rig driver in the early going, as crack detective work by the local sheriff fails to uncover their whereabouts.<br /><br />The movie actually has a lot going on, the film's hero Chase Winstead (Don Sullivan) befriends a local disc jockey by getting his car out of a jam; the DJ repays the favor by cutting a demo record for the would be singer. Chase's little sister needs a pair of braces in order to walk and they're provided by Chase's girlfriend Lisa (Lisa Simone). Comic relief is provided by the town drunk Harris (Shug Fisher), who happens to witness the creature up close and personal a couple of times, but who's buying his story? <br /><br />I remember as a kid watching any number of TV shows and movies of the 1950's in which nitroglycerin was a major factor in the outcome of a story. With four quarts of nitro just hanging around, young Chase manages to steer his souped up hot rod into the path of the looming monster to insure a successful and fiery finale.<br /><br />Even back in 1959, it seemed that corporate sponsors were a factor in movie production, you'll need more than one hand to count the number of times Mobil Oil gets it's message across.<br /><br />With all said and done, ""The Giant Gila Monster"" is one of those campy 1950's gems that requires at least one viewing so you could say you've been there and done that. Try to get your hands on the DVD box set of fifty sci-fi and horror films neatly packaged with a mix of downright terrible offerings like ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" along with screen classics like ""Nosferatu"".

"Star Trek Voyager was supposed to be groundbreaking, a fresh challenge, a slap in the face of what we had known. At least that's the way they sold it to us. The U.S.S. Voyager would be stranded in a remote sector of space unknown to mankind, truly exploring the unseen while looking for a way back. Too bad they(producers, writers) chickened out right from episode 1. What we got was more of the same, tired aliens of the week with a generic bump on their foreheads that spoke English perfectly, and loads of spatial anomalies and enough technobabble to fill Jupiter's Red Spot. We were supposed to have the first female lead, a female captain which was a wonderful idea, but we got that annoying midget of a woman, with a grating voice-pitch and schizophrenic personality. We got a stiff imitation of Leonard Nimoy, and a bunch of useless, unlikeable, bland and annoying characters as a crew. Plus, the ship always seemed a ridiculous coffee spoon. Not all was horrid, of course...naturally, Robert Picardo as the Holographic Doctor, the Special Effects, Jerry Goldsmith's Main Theme, and the Borg along with the sexy Seven of Nine did make this show watchable, and at times, even enjoyable. But it's sad, because, for a show that was supposed to throw all conventions through the window, it surely was the most conventional of them all.",Directional Techniques,Performance,
"With the name and the description, it's easy to mistake this as being another edge-of-your-seat, thrill-ride horror movie. It's anything but. Apart from having a supernatural aspect to it, it's pretty much an after-school special sort of film. Its PG-13 rating isn't even needed. The suicide element is so brief and tame, that this could still easily be rated G (remember, G doesn't have to mean kids, it just means General Audiences). The interesting thing is that, when the credits finally rolled, I was satisfied with what I'd seen. Imagine that, a movie that doesn't go for the kill and just wants to entertain you with a decent story for an hour or two. The script is...OK, the dialogue is... acceptable, the acting is good, for the most part (this movie is rife with underrated actors that are much more talented than they've ever been given credit for). What I find interesting is that everyone comes across as real people. Not ""good actors,"" just your regular, flawed bozos found on every street corner. When Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise are on a screen, you get drawn-in, but it's always ""them."" Marina Sirtis, on the other hand, makes you believe you're watching a typical house-mom type, not an actress, who's both kind and overbearing under different circumstances --just as a real person might be. There's a scene towards the end that'll have you wanting to give her a medal for realistically portraying someone in emotional agony, and not simply ""oh, the script says I'm supposed to scream here."" So, overall it's not a blockbuster, and it's not something you'll want to rush out and tell your friends about. Heck, some of the metaphysical/religious concepts used are so... well, let's just say I don't subscribe to them and politely leave it there, suffice to say they're a bit corny and detracting, in an amalgamated ""I've read a lot of spiritual books, but don't really know a thing about it"" sort of way. But, I gave this one an ""8"" score for one very good reason: It accomplished what it set out to do, and it did leave me happy that I'd watched it. With Hollywood pumping out multi-million dollar blockbusters with tons of FX and no story on a regular basis, how often can we really say that about a film these days?",Performance,,
"Well, there are a lot of movies that have been made about the Hindu-Muslim conflicts in India, and this is one of them. What is refreshing is the honesty some film-makers put into their stories - something John Matthan started with 'Sarfarosh'. 'Dev' is perhaps the most open about the issue.<br /><br />The story is about an honest cop, Dev (sounds clichéd, but is actually much more than just that!), who just believes in doing his duty. Various factors hamper his 'mission' in life - factors which all of us can relate to, such as others' ambition, greed for power, skewed ideologies and plain sycophancy. I'm sure many have faced these at our places of work! It is this basic story, set into the current Hindu-Muslim situation in India - references to Gujarat are made, the police is hand-in-glove with politicians instigating violence etc etc. Various layers are added, in the form of personal loss to the good guy (and the bad guy!), misguided youth (a very well managed sub-plot, which is seamlessly integrated into the main story) and the inevitable romance (also well integrated into the story)!<br /><br />The scripting is brilliant to say the least. With Dev (Bachchan) & Inder (Om Puri) on opposite sides of the fence on the issue of Muslims in India, their discussions are frank, open and thought provoking. (How well both of them acted is something I shall get into a little later!) This is an issue many of us would have debated with someone or the other at some point in time. All those arguments are brought out into the open - more frankly, candidly and clearly than ever before. All the exchanges are most thought provoking. Both sides feel fully justified in their stand on the issue, and for a long while, the viewer is left to choose the side he/she prefers. But then, Nihalani finally shows us where he stands, as the story unfolds further.<br /><br />Nihalani really works his magic here. He goes back to his Tamas days, when Om Puri carried his mother on a push cart ('thela'). Here, he has Fardeen doing the same with Kareena, in an almost identical situation. He also re-visits the famous Banquo's ghost scene from Macbeth. Exceedingly well done!<br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan stupefies me. He has totally re-invented himself as an actor. The angry young man is anything but that now! 'Young' went quite a few years ago (he's a grandfather now, for god's sake!), and the anger has given way to a smoldering frustration. He no longer raves and rants like he used to (it was the need of the hour when he did that). Here, he gives a truly natural performance - he comes across as just another guy, dwarfed by the system yet refusing to give in to it. He carries on from where he left off with 'Khakee'. <br /><br />Om Puri is excellent as usual. It was 'paisa-wasool' all the way whenever Amitabh and Om Puri shared screen time together! Rati Agnihotri plays a small role, and fits the character well enough. Kareena is very attractive in a plain-jane look. Fardeen Khan seems to be in the industry only because of his lineage, and attractive looks. He is clearly mis-cast, as he seems to have been in every movie that I have seen him in so far. I wonder if there will be an Indian re-make of 'Mannequin' where he can play title role! And only the title role - the come-alive character would need expressions!<br /><br />Kudos to Nihalani to bring out new and unknown faces - Kareena's friend is especially good. Unfortunately, I do not know the actress' name... Ehsaan Khan, though decent, resorted to over-acting in emotionally charged scene. I'm sure he can improve over time. <br /><br />All in all, this is a very good movie and it is the script and the acting which really carry it through!",Performance,Directional Techniques,
"Director Frank Perry, who in the early 1970s showed some honest talent and an abundance of visual wit, channels the same cartoony approach to 'life' here as he did with his ""Compromising Positions""...and the affects are equally as meager. Shelley Long dies but comes back, however there's nothing relatably human about Long's approach to acting. Yes, she's playing a klutzy ditz with a heart of gold, but Long has no shadings, and when she tries for sincerity it rings hollow (even her overly-clear speaking voice sounds as if it's coming from an echo chamber and not a person). I liked Long in the underrated ""Irreconcilable Differences"", where she really had a chance to carve out a character beyond her snippy ""Cheers"" persona. It's not that she's a bad actress, there just doesn't seem to be a soul in that body. Pert and perky, she's utterly one-dimensional, pink-and-blonde-and-bland.

She is one of the handful.<br /><br />The supporting cast was terrific as well. However, this movie was all Crawford. Most of her movies have slipped into relative obscurity today. Its unfortunate, because she was on the same level as Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis. The problem with Joan was that she never appeared in a legendary movie. Every star from that era had a movie which made legends. Hepburn had the Philadelphia's story, and Davis had all about eve. Mildred Pierce was a great movie in my opinion, However, its not highly regarded like the other classics.

Ken (TOMMY, LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM) Russell, Sean (FRIDAY THE 13TH) Cunningham, Monte (TWO LANE BLACKTOP) Hellman (name checked in an REM song too!), John (THE MATRIX Trology SFX supervisor) and lastly but not leastly, Joe (GREMLINS) Dante.<br /><br />I've seen a few message board comments trashing this movie, but let me tell you an opposing POV. This movie reflects the talents of the directors who took the time to make it. This is not SCREAM or THE RING (US) or THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE. TRAPPED ASHES goes down it's own odd and disquieting pathway to hell. It has a decidedly literary flavor, although its shocks are as unpleasant & visceral as any classic horror film.<br /><br />There's some cool acting talent along for the ride; Henry Gibson plays a man with a venomous secret; John Saxon plays a man haunted by the specter of long lost lust; Tahmoh Penikett, who plays Helo on SciFi Channel's amazing BATTLESTAR GALACTICA series, plays Saxon's younger self, a man who lets a succubus destroy a friendship and a life; even director Ken Russell gets in a hilariously strange cameo role.<br /><br />Check your expectations at the door.

Main character girl instead of traditional male: nice twist. Hints that she had a sexual past with both the Usher twins: interesting update. Male Usher twin obsessive sexual interest in her: nicely creepy. Usher twin getting her pregnant and locking her in the house: again nicely creepy.<br /><br />And then it happens. Main character finds family photos. She sees that for the past seven generations the family has produced a set of male and female twins. She mutters something in a horrified voice which cannot be understood no matter how often the movie is replayed.<br /><br />This something is enough for the housekeeper(who would you'd think, know the ""curse"" all along) to suddenly say the family is cursed, to try to end the main character's pregnancy, and to try to kill the male twin. There is running and screaming and people dying, with the viewer with no idea WHY. There is a ""twist"" ending which makes no sense, again because the ""curse"" is unknown, and if the main character does supposedly know it, why is she happily having the babies? <br /><br />The visuals are good in the movie, the director is fairly good, the early creep factor at a decent level but because of the ending I can't give this movie a good rating.",Plot,Visual Effect,

Worse than that when Billie finds out she`s pregnant by the rape she hardly bats an eyelid . I don`t think I have to hammer home to you how ridiculous this appears on screen . I know it`s a TVM so there`s broadcasting standards to observe and I suppose this prissy attitude is slightly more preferable than the full throttle stomach churning exploitation of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE but to treat such a serious subject in such a light manner comes close to being offensive .

"In two and a half hours Clint Eastwood paints a thought provoking piece on heroism and war-propaganda. The film tells three stories: first it is the WW II battle of Iwo Jima where thousands of soldiers (Japanese and American) died 'conquering' that island. In the style of Saving Private Ryan (Spielberg is a producer of Flags) the viewer gets a astounding look at war with a lot of blood, guts and CGI. Second is the story of a son of one of the flag raisers on that island, who interviews other survivors of that battle to understand his dad a little better. This is very moving stuff, but stands a little pale in comparison to the final storyline. This is where veteran-director Eastwood really shines. Like his meditation on violence Unforgiven, Flags takes a closer look at heroism where soldiers by chance get into the spotlight of the war-propaganda-machine. Some may say that Eastwood made an anti-war film or even an anti-America film, but they're wrong. Flags is very critical on the way war is sold to the public. There's nothing honorable about killing or to be killed on the battlefield. The only thing that matters is that you protect you're friends in your platoon and that they protect you. Flags is one of the best war movies I ever saw, maybe even better than Ryan, because it's never sentimental and always honest in its portrayal of the soldiers and war in general.",Plot,Directional Techniques,

"Andy Milligan receives a lot of harsh criticism as one of the least talented filmmakers ever. If I had only seen his admittedly lousy horror films, I'd definitely agree. However, after reading ""The Ghastly One"" (one of the best biographies ever) and seeing this, a sexploitation drama he made, I completely bite my tongue. The man made films on budgets H.G. Lewis would find unthinkable and his misanthropic world view comes through loud and clear. Any Milligan film, even at their worst, makes for a compulsive viewing, especially if you are a bit familiar with the man's background. However, ""Fleshpot on 42nd Street"" is a legitimately good film, in a really scuzzy kind of way. The acting is good, the characters sympathetic, and it has a really unique vibe.<br /><br />One of the core reasons for the film's success is the central performance from Laura Cannon. Shes sympathetic and comes across as a naive innocent in a depraved world. For someone as notoriously misogynistic as Milligan, its rather odd to see such a likable female character. Harry Reems (who starred in the legendary ""Deep Throat"" the year before) is also good as the man who offers her an escape from the street life. Milligan's direction is bland, but he makes great use out of location filming. The man's background was in plays and it shows.

""Possession's"" preview describes an amazing journey into the depths of love, transcending time, making Shakespeare look like the writer of ""Not Another Teen Movie"", and uses Enya to further add atmosphere to the scene, with her chilling emotional sound, filling your stomach with a mixture of magic, desire, and most importantly a NEED to see the movie.

Did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth, in different time frames (Attilla the Hun wasn't a contemporary of preliterate Hellenic cultures, nor were the Vikings contemporary to the Pyramid builders) speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day English(except for the inflections they ""do not"" use), which has been influenced by Latin, ancient Greek, Danish and French? <br /><br />2 Cultural differences can't be overcome so easily, trust has to be won, yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders.

"I didn't think SciFi Channel could broadcast a worse myth-&-monster movie than MINOTAUR. I was wrong.<br /><br />It's okay to make a movie on the cheap; not everyone has access to a big budget, and amazing things can be done with a little imagination and talent. But there's very little of those commodities here. Acting is at a high school level. Direction is worse. Dialogue is trite. Scenes lurch from one dull monster attack to another, with occasional babe (er, goddess) interludes to break the monotony. The goddesses look and sound as it they're reading cue cards at a second-rate beauty contest.<br /><br />Why must the makers of such movies mess with Greek myth, about which they clearly know (and care) nothing? Here, Homer the tale-teller appears as part of Odysseus's crew. That's an okay idea. Except this Homer (played by the worst actor of the lot, which is saying something) scribbles notes (with a feather quill!) and fawns over the heroes like an embedded reporter in Iraq. Legend tells us that Homer was blind, and recited his stories from memory.

"This series proposes a pair of arguments: That ( 1 ) the principles of Game Theory applied to domestic policy resulted in a loss of freedom and ( 2 ) the same principles applied to foreign policy, specifically in Iraq, caused Islamic extremism making the West a target for terrorists.<br /><br />The second thesis contradicts historical facts. The invasion of Iraq took place in 2003. The destruction of the World Trade Center happened in 2001. The first attempt to destroy the same complex using a giant truck bomb, killing and injuring several, took place in 1992! The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards took the 50 American hostages in 1979.<br /><br />Regarding personal liberty and the effect upon it of Game Theory, the argument is advanced via two tactics: avoiding difficult questions and the assertion as fact of contentions without evidence.<br /><br />The film-maker repeatedly asserts that a central assumption of Game Theory is the self-interested behaviour of individuals. It is repeatedly asserted that this is a ""bleak"" vision, as though that bleakness were itself sufficient reason to reject it. Never once in the entire series is it asked whether this bleak vision is or is not correct! It is as though in the mind-set of this film-maker and his intended audience the mere undesirability of a thing is sufficient reason for us to regard it as not true! This is, indeed, instructive. It does explain a great deal about the behaviour and posturing of Western ""intellectuals"" who endorse freedom and the revolutionary pursuit of the liberation of oppressed and minorities yet who consistently support those movements and institutions that most obstruct such trends: previously the Soviet Union, today reactionary Islam.<br /><br />As far as asserting facts unsubstantiated by evidence, the series contains numerous examples but one, in particular. It is asserted as a fact that a result of the widespread use of objective assessment and diagnostic criteria in psychiatry is that an entire generation of people took to applying such tests to themselves and as a result presented for psychiatric treatment of their behaviour. Thereby producing a self-imposed conformity effect. The only support for this assertion in the series is an anecdotal comment by a psychiatrist, in his office, that this was his personal observation. This clip is shown twice in the series. No other support for this contention is offered.<br /><br />A contention, easily contradicted. Ask yourself, have you ever set yourself a formal diagnostic test for psychiatric disorder and gone to a doctor as a result? Do you know anyone in your family to have done that? Have you ever heard even indirectly of any person in your wider circle of associates who has done that? Have you ever before heard of such a thing at all? I have observed psychiatry throughout the entire three decades that the claim applies to. I have never come across such a bizarre assertion other than in this series.<br /><br />If I try to argue the case for the assertion, I can only imagine that it refers to one of two things: The popularity of quizzes in magazines along the lines of ""Take this months test to find out if you are a workaholic"". Or the widespread phenomenon of the ""worried well"" who present at therapy for the treatment of non-existent conditions, in effect, life's dissatisfaction.<br /><br />As far as the latter goes, it has been known for about a century that such ""worried well"" form the multitude of those who seek ""therapy"". Such behaviour has nothing whatever to do with either objective diagnostic criteria or Game Theory. Nor do such clients but rarely alter their behaviour in any significant way.<br /><br />On the other hand, pop-quizzes of a self-questioning kind have been popular for almost as long as the kind of magazines that they appear in. A long time before the emergence of objective diagnostic criteria in psychiatry and owing nothing to either that or Game Theory.<br /><br />I do not know if these are what the film-maker refers to but they offer no support for his contention that Western societies have become in some way self-straight-jacketed by conformity as a result. It seems, rather, that this is merely what he would like to believe, and hopes that by asserting it boldly, repeatedly and each time quickly passing on to something else, he will like an after-dinner illusionist convince us that something has happened that in reality has not! Only in the last few minutes of this series is any alternative vision to the ""bleak"" contention that Human behaviour is self-interested offered. It is that we...may...instead... assume... and act upon the ...assumption ...that Human Nature is capable of change! Not only is this a major contention, offered as an assumption without any supporting evidence, but it implicitly concedes that there is substance to the ""bleak"" contention, such that an ""alternative"" is warranted, whilst yet again dodging the real issue: is it or is it not true? The ""retro"" montage of archival material is edited for the most part according to principles of affective consonance or non-rational association. Images are mainly matched to the narrative according to the associations that they evoke, rather than to illustrate facts. Typical is the repeated use of a pairing of reference to post-war ideals of personal freedom with what appears to be a snippet from a film of housewives at a workshop for jive-dancing from about 1965. Why? The function of such a technique is to massage the viewer into the acceptance of assertions whilst de-potentiating rational engagement. It is like the ""programming"" scene from ""The Parallax View"". The effect is the unpleasant sense that the film-maker is attempting to make us accept that against which we might otherwise be guarded.<br /><br />Replace that monologue with a sound-track of dance-music and the programme would look little different from that one-time staple of late night viewing ""The Trip"".",Plot,,
"Definite Spoilers Ahead. Please don't read if you haven't seen the film yet and want to be surprised.<br /><br />My biggest question -- why do directors/producers think viewers are stupid? Maybe most people just sit back and enjoy the ride...but why spend so much time and money to make a beautiful-looking movie like this, populated with some fairly good actors, and based on a good, classic story, if you don't care enough about the story to employ a thoughtful writer or two? <br /><br />Anyway...this movie has too many plot holes to count, but here are the most glaring, in my opinion.<br /><br />Why would Emily leave a comfortable, hot bath to answer the phone? In such a lushly appointed apartment, it's hard to believe it doesn't have an answering system or built-in voice mail. And even if it doen't, there's been no sign that it's going to ring an annoyingly long time when Emily starts moving to answer it.<br /><br />Why was Steven so easily dismissed as a suspect -- just because he was ""on the phone"" during the attack? Of course he didn't commit the attack -- the attacker is DEAD. His having an alibi for the time of the attack does not clear him of arranging it. If he was even considered for a moment, he wasn't a suspect for committing the attack, but for planning it...and his ""alibi"" doesn't clear him of that.<br /><br />Steven was so careful about so many parts of his ""perfect murder plan"" -- why would he so sloppily toss the cell phone out of his car, on his way from the poker game? If it were found (which it never was, apparently) the fact that it was on his return route would be pretty incriminating. There are plenty of places, like the East River, to toss something.<br /><br />It's obvious the dead man lived in a very scary neighborhood (Emily visits and it's pretty dangerous looking) -- so we're supposed to believe the killer only used one key and had one lock on his door? I live in a nice part of New York and there are four locks between the apartment and the outside world -- but Emily was able to get into that apartment with just one key. Doubtful.<br /><br />When Steven confronts Emily, it becomes a complication that there's something at the artist's loft connecting him to them: her wedding ring. Steven says he'll go get it. WHY does it matter if that connection exists? There are obviously many others they can't do anything about -- like the negatives to the photos he's just shown her; money that he's confessed to paying the artist; at least one of her friends who knows about the affair. And, he's supposedly a blackmailer, so wouldn't one assume he has some hidden ""proof""? Why does it matter that the ring is in the loft? Surely, no matter what, Steven and Emily don't think they're going to be able to pretend Emily never had an affair with David!?<br /><br />When Steve hands over money in Washington Square Park, David tells him the tape is a ""commemerative copy"" -- there's been no guarantee (that we've heard, at least) that there's no other copy of the tape. Who would assume that was the only copy??? And of course, we soon learn it wasn't.<br /><br />If your husband tried to have you killed, and you had the proof (the tape), would you confront him (even with a gun in your pocket) or get the heck out and go to the police? <br /><br />Of course David was recording the murder plot, when Steven laid it out at his own apartment. Why wouldn't he? If Steven was such a good planner, why would he not ""shake down"" David to make sure he didn't have a tape recorder? It would be in character not to trust him.<br /><br />Argh! I want back the time I wasted watching this thing....",Plot,,
"TCM was showing this as part of their ""Oscar"" month. I ended up staying up late to watch it.<br /><br />Wow, what a waste of time! The problem isn't KC or WH or their chemistry (or lack thereof), but the idiotic plot that just doesn't make any sense. I could fill pages with examples, but the one that made me really sorry that I had sacrificed my beauty sleep to watch this was when Costner's character dives into a freezing lake to knock a kid out of a boat, but for no apparent reason other than he just figure out that the bad guy is nearby. After safely out of the water, the boat stops in the middle of the lake and blows up. Since neither Costner or Houston's characters had been in the boat or shown any interest in the boat, the whole idea that someone would try to kill them by blowing it up made absolutely no sense at all.<br /><br />And what about the ridiculous attempt at romance, which is obviously the whole point of the film? There is not one credible scene that explains either character's attraction for the other. None. So, the reason for no chemistry between the two is that the idiot who wrote this didn't provide any dialog or staging to provide them with any motivation.<br /><br />So, my advice is to buy a Whitney Houston album so you can hear her fabulous voice without interference from all the foley noise, and then rent ""No Way Out,"" which provides all sorts of motivation for the romance and sex scenes with an equally serious, but far more plausible performance from Costner.",Others,,
"I read an in-depth article about this series in either ""Filmfax"" or ""Outre"" and it stuck in my mind - I had never heard of the series before. When I saw ""The Very Best of One Step Beyond"" DVD on sale for about $6 - I thought why not buy it??? I have never regretted it. I don't know whether the standard of television is so abysmal now but I have seen half the episodes and apart from 2 (The Aerialist with Mike ""Touch"" Connors and Yvette Vickers and ""The Ordeal on Locust Street"" - just my own personal view) they are all winners. Some of the standouts for me :- ""Night of April 14"" with Patrick Macnee - about a couple that are going on their honeymoon aboard the ""Titanic"". The host then talked about a book that had been published in the 1890s about a ship called the ""Titan"" that could not be sunk<br /><br />- it was very eerie!!! I must say that all the shows are based on real life occurrences. ""The Return of Michael Campion"" with Patrick O'Neal - about a man that holidays on a remote island - yet all the locals know him and dislike him!!! That show was a talking point all the afternoon - how could that happen etc. ""The Vision"" with Pernell Roberts about a group of soldiers in World War 1 that see a strange glow in the sky. I have read of a few different people who saw the same glow in different parts of the world at the very same time. ""The Dark Room"" with Cloris Leachman - about a strange man that consents to be photographed. ""Echo"" with Ross Martin, about a man's murderous past that catches up with him. Joanne Linville was in a couple and made an impression. ""Delusion"" starred the lovely Susanne Pleschette and ""The Visitor"" has a young and very handsome Warren Beatty.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",Performance,,
"This is a very funny and sad movie about two girls (Enid and Rebecca) just entering the real world trying to figure out what to do with life, just as Seymour, a middle aged man, struggles through his own life as he has trouble relating to other people. While Enid and Rebecca discover that life outside of high school isn't as great as they imagined it to be, Seymour (who already knows about the loneliness of life) tries for once in his life to actually start living instead of just floating through life. Steve Buscemi, who plays Seymour, has one of his most memorable performances, and Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are perfect fits for their roles. Anyone who feels like they don't quite fit in with society will surely find something to like in this movie. There has never been a teen movie like this, and there probably isn't any that are better than this. And don't forget about the old man waiting for the bus. Could this old man have the answer?",Plot,,
"This is a dull and badly choreographed and performed dance film. There is a group of women in white dresses with permanent smiles on their faces walking around on a blue field. When seen from above, they form shapes. There are two airships above them, with stewardesses sitting around a table with a large pile of grapes on it. Under the table, another woman is stealing the grapes through a small hole. Other reviewers here have called the film beautiful and symbolic, but I saw neither any beauty nor symbols. The only thing this proves is that it's not as easy to make an ""artsy"" film as some people might think. There may or may not be some meaning behind this film, but meaning is far less important than making a film that's interesting to watch.",Others,,
"When Lucille Ball was an acclaimed, but not very widely known B picture actress, Joan Davis was winning a lot more acclaim for her own brand of goofy physical humor on radio and on film. She was a mainstay of support to a lot of the glamor girls and guys at 20th Century Fox. <br /><br />A long term extra marital affair with Eddie Cantor helped push her career along as Cantor featured her on radio and had her co-star in two of his films.<br /><br />Like so many players when the motion picture studios started cutting down production and leaving people out of work, Davis turned to television. Unfortunately one year too late to get credit for originality.<br /><br />Lucille Ball and her real life husband beat her to the tube by a year. They put on a very successful situation comedy about a wacky wife with an exasperated husband that we all know about.<br /><br />So when Joan Davis debuted I Married Joan in 1952 she was accused of copying Lucy. Not so as any viewing of her films will so demonstrate.<br /><br />But Lucy was there first and got the deserved credit. <br /><br />I Married Joan was a very funny show that trailed in the wake of I Love Lucy. It ended in 1955 because her TV husband Jim Backus quit the show. As Judge Bradley J. Stevens, he was her exasperated straight man of a husband. He'd get to show his comic flair later on in Gilligan's Island.<br /><br />Sad that Joan Davis was never able to develop another television show to show her talent before she died.<br /><br />A very funny lady, with a very funny show.",Performance,,
"I literally gasped out loud in the movie theatre when Jolie's character went up to the African child to rescue him from the vulture. That child's face gives new meaning to the saying ""a picture is worth a thousand words"". That face epitomizes what the horror of war and famine really means in terms of human suffering.<br /><br />I went to see this movie because I really enjoy watching Angelina Jolie perform, despite the distraction of her oversized lips. I think she is an excellent actress and I'm never bored when I see her on the big screen. Paired up with Clive Owen, I thought the chemistry between the two of them sizzled. I'm wondering what those who voted less than 7 for this picture expected to see when they viewed this movie or even if they did see it.<br /><br />I thought this movie was great and despite the horrible circumstances and the tragic ending, I left the theatre feeling I had been very entertained. I gave it a 10 and look forward to seeing it again when it comes out on video.",Performance,,

And when is this 40+ year old woman going to stop squealing like a stuck pig. Girls in middle school are able to express themselves better.<br /><br />The male actors were, well, unimpressive at best.<br /><br />The story line could've have been developed a lot more, with interesting banter and twists and turns.

"""Place Vendome"" makes a few strange decisions early on. You would expect a thriller set in the Paris jewel industry to be glamorous and sexy, but Nicole Garcia has other ideas. Instead, she presents the industry as corrupt, jaded and full of downbeat, sleazy people. Deals take place behind closed doors, in cheap hotel rooms, and dimly-lit office suites. Garcia does everything to make this atmosphere suffocating - there are few outdoors scenes initially. When the action shifts briefly to London, there are no establishing shots. The only clue that we're no longer in Paris is that the dialogue switches to English.<br /><br />This, no doubt, is an attempt to add realism to the milieu. It succeeds, but at the cost of draining the film of interest. Little narrative momentum is created, and the low-key lighting, presumably aimed at creating a noir atmosphere, ends up murky instead.<br /><br />The main interest lies, predictably enough, with Catherine Deneuve, in yet another mid-life crisis role. Of course, she holds the attention like the old pro she is, but this is itself a problem. We're introduced to various mysterious characters when Deneuve is off-screen, but they seem lifeless and uninteresting by comparison.<br /><br />And yet, the final half-hour actually works. Much is explained about the characters' motivations in a haunting flashback scene, set in an unforgiving wintry landscape. Following on from that the film finally develops some tension. However, this seems to be too little, too late. This is a wasted opportunity.",Visual Effect,Performance,
"This review is based on the 73-minute version of this film sold through Luminous Film and Video Wurks. It's a minimalist tale of three people--a gypsy girl, a rich woman, and a mysterious man who likes to be in the buff whilst riding his horse--engaged in a three way relationship. The sex scenes are blunt, perfunctory, and frankly quite dull, the characters are one-dimensional and lacking in motivation, and the film's conclusion is almost as ridiculous as its contrived opening sequence. I'm not sure what the other reviewers liked about La Visita del Vicio (titled Sodomia on the Luminous tape), as it bored me to tears. Perhaps not quite as bad as the worst Jesus Franco film, but close.",Plot,,
"There are low budget/direct to video movies, and then there is trash like this.<br /><br />Trying to follow the plot of this film can actually hurt at time with the amount of thinking that was required to follow what was going on. Was there a Cobra Khan or was he just part of the kids imagination of the white ninja. Was the white ninjas back story based on a comic or were the kids just dreaming it. What was the deal with that scene with the clown fight and the balloons. Why were they bouncing on balloons for 15 minutes?! Also the kids were trained by a Van Damn wannabe who while solidly built lacked any acting talent. Also the box art, why couldn't the box designers at least pick an honest one to give the audience an idea how ugly the costumes were which looked like was made of cheap pieces of costume purchased in Chinatown.<br /><br />Acting was poor at best. It was fairly obvious by the end of the film that the kids could not do any of there own stunts which was probably why the stunt kids wore the awful costumes.<br /><br />The film at times seemed like a bad live action cartoon. This film goes so far as to hit clichés such as fishing rods and bait to lure the one kid's mom , following the kids by hiding in a trash can.<br /><br />There were also subtle problems such as some of the film was not properly edited to make it feel like it fit in the movie as the lighting was off and it seemed the purpose of it was to purely drag the film on.<br /><br />The film director insists that to allow the film to be acceptable by foreign markets he had to put in work out scenes which could be misconstrued as intentionally trying to torture the viewers.<br /><br />But the worst torture by far was saved for last in the form of the ""Virtual Reality fight"" which consisted of random fighters fighting sped up using such weapons as silly string. I honestly question the mental health of the writers and seriously wonder if some of them were on drugs when I watch this scene, it makes me cry every time cause it hurts so very much.<br /><br />My advice, do not watch this movie ever, unless you go in wanting to be subjected to the worst kinds of mental torture a film can present you with. There is nothing to laugh at in the film's intended humor. Not even the mistakes are funny most of the time. You might get out a few guilty laughs at some of the dumber moments, granted they might just be a response triggered by the brain cells this film kills at speeds higher then grain alcohol.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
"I grudgingly watched this movie at my fiancé's request. But I really enjoyed it wholeheartedly and I laughed out loud at least a dozen time. In addition to being very clever and funny, the story was interesting and heartwarming. Cary Grant player Jerry Warriner, am man to whom we are introduced while he is in a tanning bed to help provide the alibi that he was on vacation in Florida. We never find out what he was 'really' doing but it was probably naughty. He returns home to an empty house early in the morning. He doesn't know where his wife is and then she returns in a full evening gown with a handsome ""continental"" man. It sounds dramatic, but its actually very very funny.

"Simon Templar (George Sanders), known as ""The Saint"", whom everyone believed to be in Egypt, suddenly turns up back in Philadelphia, at the home of his friend, Professor Bitts (Thomas W. Ross). Although the reasons aren't given in the film, apparently there is some disagreement over Simon's moral character. When bodies start turning up with incriminating evidence pointing to The Saint, the police try to track him down. However, it turns out that there is more to the story than meets the eye.<br /><br />I probably shouldn't be reviewing this film until I watch it again (if I do), but I'll just revise my review then if appropriate. As it stands, I have to give this film a generous 4 out of 10.<br /><br />While The Saint's Double Trouble has promise--nice black and white photography, some good performances (especially by Sanders and Jonathan Hale as inspector Fernack), one of my favorite actors/character actors, Bela Lugosi, has an odd part in it, and the story seems like it should be interesting--the script was a disaster. Part of the problem may have been that this is apparently an entry in a long-running series, and there's no way it's going to make sense out of the context of the series. I haven't seen any of the other films yet, so I have to review this one in isolation.<br /><br />The script ends up being largely loose threads. Important parts of the backstory are neither shown nor explained. There is a mummy (the presence of which got me very interested in the beginning) that ends up being meaningless to the plot (the little use it had could have been much more easily accomplished by another means). At one point, half of a knife makes an appearance as a token of a mystery, but it is never mentioned again. Characters completely drop out of the film.<br /><br />Worst of all, the plot hinges on the appearance of Boss Duke Bates, a look-alike for Simon Templar, also played by George Sanders. As can be expected, there are a number of points that rest on confused identities (that's the bulk of the film, actually). The problem is that by the end, I was also so confused that I had no idea which appearance of George Sanders was supposed to be which character, and confusion on this didn't seem to be the point of the conclusion.<br /><br />Again, maybe this is a fine chapter in a longer story when viewed with the other Saint films, in order. But to start here, I can't recommend The Saint's Double Trouble. It doesn't work as a stand-alone film.",Performance,Plot,

And the girls can really rock too! The concert scene was a lotta fun (trying to find MP3 files). People these movies are all about the fun so don't judge!

Maybe it's just the script, but this movie makes it look as of the mother is not so much against her daughter's relationship, as she is using the state courts' bigotry to get back at her daughter for not letting her be as much a part of raising the child as she'd like.

"Can one little kid ruin a movie? <br /><br />Yup.<br /><br />Think I'm exaggerating? Watch this film. You can see Exhibit A of it right here in this science-fiction ""classic"" film, a re-make of the 1950s hit movie of the same title. This re-make actually would have only ""bad"" without inserting this annoying kid, but he made it ""horrendous."" Jaden Smith as ""Jacob Benson"" is a spoiled, chip-on-his-shoulder, disrespectful kid who incessantly talks back to his mother, who puts up with it - which is equally annoying for most audiences. <br /><br />What was the purpose of inserting this kid in the film? What were the writers thinking? I'm glad to see a number of reviewers here agree with me on this one. I guess if you're the son of a famous actor (Will Smith), they'll insert you in film roles, even if there is no purpose to it. And Hollywood wonders why people don't go to the movies much any more, and they sneer at pitiful re-makes? <br /><br />Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves was a good choice for his starring role: an emotionless robot-like alien. Reeves is such a wooden-sounding actor to begin with that playing a bland robot is good casting for him. ""Klaatu"" is tailor-made for him.<br /><br />Comedy was provided via the ludicrous environmental fear-mongering message in here. I laughed out loud in several spots when ""Klaatu"" explained to us the reason for his mission. It's so stupid, it's laughable. I was reminded of Ed Wood's horrible sci-fi stories in the 1950s.<br /><br />I will say some of the special-effects and the surround sound in here is excellent. It was the highlight of the movie. These are good visuals and good audio, and a nice film to view on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, the story got in the way.",Performance,Visual Effect,Music
"The first half is OK, but chapters in Japan are purely awful. Judging from the high rating of this film, I must conclude that non-Japanese audience didn't find absurdity in Uma's and Lucy's Japanese or unrealistic sword fighting scenes. My 3-year-old nephew speaks much better Japanese than those two actresses. Their pronunciation was so bad that they sounded like mentally ill.<br /><br />In Japan, TV is showing much more authentic sword fight scenes almost everyday. Uma looks quite weak. No authenticity in her.<br /><br />All in all, worse than Pearl Harbor. There's nothing wrong with an American who doesn't know enough about Japanese culture or language. But it's different when he makes a movie about it. I'm sure American people will find it offensive when a foreign filmmaker who doesn't know much about western or cowboy makes a non-authentic western film.",Plot,,
"The plot is at the kindergarten level. It's just a crazy man killing people in gory methods, often doing obscene things with the corpses. His ""friends"" help him along the way and participating in one murder during his birthday party, of which some of his presents include an inflatable sheep!! The atmosphere is really bad. It mostly takes place in a New Jersey trucking warehouse, in and around trucks, and in the company's office building where Frank lives. If anything, there's a lack of atmosphere! It just plods along without any connection between scenes. It's just a set of scenes smashed together.<br /><br />None of the cast is worth mentioning but I'll mention one, the main ""cast member"", as none can act in the slightest. Frank O'Brien plays...*Drum Roll* Frank!! His character is an exaggeration of his real life.<br /><br />For the movie, Frank is an excessively slow and old man who was once homeless and an alcoholic. Now he does menial tasks with a trucking company.<br /><br />True story is that Frank O'Brien found his wife in bed with their priest and, feeling so bad, he became homeless and alcoholic. He's now old and suffering from some type of senility and dementia. He has dentures but that does NOT account for his speech impediment. His words are so unintelligible that his words are subtitled in yellow -- only his! Aside from this, I feel sad for Frank O'Brien because it seems as if he, and his slowness, are just being used and exploited for the amusement of the crew and the viewers. But mostly I found it just sad.<br /><br />The only Cast member of ""some"" fame is Tasim Atkinson who plays The Tease, one of Frank's personal ad women and victims. In real life, she's a ""big woman"" exotic dancer. She appeared on The Howard Stern Show a few times and promoted the movie -- probably the only reason that this movie was sold anywhere.<br /><br />Directed and written by Steve Ballot as Escalp Don Bladé. He's obviously an amateur. His writing is terrible and without direction. He used a ridiculous pseudo name which, in itself, is amateurish.<br /><br />The cinematography is terrible, like the rest of this masterpiece. It's obvious that it's shot with camcorders and edited with VCRs and other low-tech equipment. The picture is faded and the hues are awful.<br /><br />The SFX, ugh!! Basically, it has a lot of fake blood, fake wounds, ripped out eyes, and several fake penises -- yes, penises!! The sound is like through a tunnel. The music is sparse. The best song is by a band called the Young and Fabulous but even that isn't great.<br /><br />This is, without a doubt, THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN! The story is ridiculous, the cinematography is awful, terrible effects, terrible sound, I can NOT understand Frank's speech which is exploited and hurtful. The title is irrelevant unless you watch the deleted scenes/alternate ending. The festival extra bashes Frank more! Butter sound, state of the art crap! A few jokes are mildly amusing but most are just too vulgar or immature to be funny. I couldn't wait for the DVD to end!!<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this crap which makes Troma look like Broadway!! There's tons of extras for such a crappy movie.",Plot,Performance,

Yes, Joan Crawford belting out the songs and dancing with her football player shoulder pads underneath her leotards are both silly, but there was a certain goofy charm to the film. It definitely was a last gasp film--a 1950s film that looked amazingly like a 1930s or early 40s musical except for the film being in color.<br /><br />Joan is the scheming woman bent on success as a singer/dancer. Despite having only marginal talent (my opinion, not that of the people in the film), she makes it to the big time only to discover she is all alone. Then, she discovers her blind pianist has secretly loved her all these years and the movie ends in a romantic clinch.<br /><br />Contrived? Yep. A bit over-the-top? You betcha.

In my opinion, Regina (Debi Mazar) and Floyd (Chris Penn) were like Cruella and her henchmen, Horace and Jasper! I was so glad when the puppies got them all dirty. I mean, what human being would want to drown five sweet, cute, innocent puppies? When Beethoven caused the deck of Taylor's (Ashley Hamilton) lake house to collapse, I was relieved. This was because he saved Ryce (Nicholle Tom) from being raped. In conclusion, I highly recommend this cute movie to all you dog lovers or Charles Grodin fans who have not seen it.",Plot,,
"It doesn't need saying that Sergei Eisenstein was one of cinema's most significant innovators, and his mastering of the montage was forever to alter how films were made and perceived by audiences. I can't confess to being Eisenstein's greatest admirer  not through any aversion to his work, but simply due to inexperience. Aside from the 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925),' a prerequisite for any budding film buff, I'd previously only seen his debut effort 'Glumov's Diary (1923),' a brief and plot-less short that is rather difficult to come by. 'Sentimental Romance (1930)' was co-directed by Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov, who worked together on several occasions. This was the pair's first venture into ""talkies,"" and I must admit to being impressed by the film's complex mastery of this new medium. Dialogue is absent, with the exception of the lone female protagonist's melancholy opera performance, and rhythmic editing is used to synchronise the music with the accompanying images. IMDb inexplicably lists 'Sentimental Romance' as a comedy short, which is odd since there isn't a trace of humour in sight.<br /><br />Instead, this is one of the saddest films I've seen in weeks, a mournful and bittersweet ode to inescapable loneliness. I don't know what the singer (played by Mara Griy) was singing about, but her solitary plight really broke my heart. There are really two sides to Eisenstein and Aleksandrov's film. The first, comprising the opening five minutes or so, is a frenetic and zany montage of trees falling down, intercut with crashing ocean waves, which are spliced so ingeniously into place that I could swear I saw a shot of water actually engulfing a forest. Then everything slows down a bit, and Eisenstein briefly steps back from the editing console. The singer is introduced as a silent silhouette against a brightly-lit window, and the camera catches her movements smoothly and gracefully. Though likely inspired by the ever-more-popular Surrealist works of the late 1920s and 1930s  namely 'Un chien andalou (1929),' 'H2O (1929)' and 'The Blood of a Poet (1930)'  I like this effort much better. It lacks the pretensions of its contemporaries, and has considerably more heart than I imagined possible for a work of surrealism.",Performance,Directional Techniques,Music
"I started watching this with no idea of what i was going to get. And what i ended up getting left me very unimpressed.<br /><br />It seemed a disjointed mess stuck together with scotch tape and staples. And it was like one of those typical European productions where the storyline would obsess about inconsequentials and make sure lots and lots and lots of screen time was spent on those inconsequentials. And then the actual story would get next to zilch screen time.<br /><br />About the only thing worthwhile to this was the performance of Jason London who gave it his sincerity as a dedicated vampire hunter. He was kind of cartoony, but then vampires aren't exactly the most realistic of movie subjects.<br /><br />The movie had some good points like the terrific landscapes and the romanian baddies kidnapping people for the vampires.<br /><br />Hauer as Dracula? I thought he was spoofing it at first like Nielson in Dracula: Dead and Loving It. Hauer was outstanding in The Hitcher and Blind Fury, but Dracula he ain't.<br /><br />Dracula movies have become such dreck. Hacks get a hold of the idea and then make a big cheesy awful mess of it. Blade 3 had an interesting and rather chilling version of Dracula, but the movie was kind of disappointingly stupidified into shlock. The last ""Dracula"" movie that i can recall seeing that left me satisfied as being worthy of the genre was Fright Night, and that was made over 20 years ago.<br /><br />Is this actually worth seeing? Well, i have absolutely no intention to ever watch it again. Let that be your guide. And consider that i've watched Fright Night probably at least 10 or 15 times already and will probably do so again another 10 or 15 times. While Fright Night is more than a little tongue-in-cheek (or neck), it had its chilling moments. Oh hell, why waste your time on this turkey... Rent Fright Night instead.

"It's amazing to read the negative critiques for 'Crumb'-- the venom poured onto it by reviewers with little explanation as to why they reacted so strongly. Just like the negative critics in the film itself, the critics here take everything Crumb produces at face value and lash out blindly with declamations of misanthropy, misogyny, racism and whatever other damning indictments they can lay their hands on. It seems the more emotionally honest and direct a film is (or a cartoon strip for that matter), the more people will hate it.<br /><br />I suppose if you hold a mirror up to someone's ugly face, you shouldn't expect him to be grateful for being given the chance to see the way he really looks, even if this is the way we all really look.",Others,,

This beautifully filmed and superbly directed drama chronicles his long, enlightening journey back home, as he meets some interesting people and learns about life. Ivashov, in his film debut, gives a remarkably natural and free-wheeling performance as the soldier who is basically a good-natured country boy. Prokhorenko is beautiful and endearing as a girl he meets during his journey. This simple and moving film has some heart-wrenching moments, but its central message is simply to point out the the absurdities of war.",Directional Techniques,Plot,
"Patrick Still Lives is a curious piece of cult cinema; not for its content, but merely for the fact that it was made. Patrick was an obscure (and rather boring) Australian thriller released in 1978 and I doubt even the makers of it would have planned a sequel; but for some reason Giallo a Venezia director Mario Landi saw fit to direct a (presumably) unofficial sequel to it anyway. I have no idea what the actual reasons are for this film being made; but given Italy's film-making record, I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that this film started life as merely a thriller about a comatose patient with telekinetic powers and ended as a 'sequel' to Patrick simply to cash in on the title. Anyway, the plot here is just as thin as it was in the original film and focuses on a comatose patient named Patrick. He may be in a coma but this doesn't stop him killing as he has telekinetic powers, and the guests staying at his father's spa soon find themselves becoming victim to Patrick's murderous rage.<br /><br />All in all, it really has to be said that Patrick Still Lives isn't very good. However, it is fun in places; and Mario Landi has proved once and for all that films about murderous comatose patients are much better when they feature a bunch of gory death scenes. Most of the death scenes in this film are ridiculous, but at least the director doesn't hold back and we get treated to a range of grisly ways for the main characters to die. As anyone who has seen Giallo a Venezia will expect, much of it is of the misogynistic variety; with one death scene in particular, which sees one of the ladies have a poker rammed up her vagina (in a really rather bizarre scene that has to be seen to be believed!) being a major standout. Nudity is strongly featured also, most of it from the female cast members. Outside of the nudity and gore, there's not a great deal to like here to be honest. The film is not badly put together and the director shows some interesting use of colour, but the plot is pretty much nonexistent and much of the film is just padding for the death scenes. But hey, I love this stuff and despite its numerous problems, I'm going to give it a thumbs up anyway.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
"Other comments here allude to fake reviews by marketing or crew persons hyping the film out of proportion. This sometimes is used to attract international sales. My review is not one of those. If you want to amuse yourself by reading deliberately hoaxed reviews have a look at LIQUID BRIDGE, THE PACT, SUMMER CITY and all the films produced or directed by Phil Avalon. You will find they are all rave reviews for hilariously awful amateurish failures. Just cross connect any film with his name on them and get set for a night of uproarious laughter. Also, the new release WOLF CREEK will be the next title to get cast and crew rave reviews all out of proportion to its lame sad reality. Anyway.......LOST THINGS seems like a first feature by a new Australian film maker who just might go on to better things. And I do not mean SWIMFAN 2. One SWIMFAN was bad enough. LOST THINGS however, is a daylight horror film - a very difficult genre of film to get right. This one does, first go. Viewers might be readily assisted by first seeing classics like THE INNOCENTS and DEAD OF NIGHT to get a sense of the eerie outdoor chills this neat low budget thriller has to offer. In the 70s there was a horror cycle of pix in Australia and two well made examples LOST THINGS subconsciously owes a lot of imagery and style to are THE LONG WEEKEND with John Hargreaves, also set on a scary beach, and SUMMERFIELD which was a sunny setting for deadly menace. I would also pointer the truly chilling British film THE WICKER MAN to add a clear sense of what LOST THINGS has to offer. This new Australian pic seems made for almost nothing and looks to be shot on bleached 16mm, enlarged for a welcome cinema release. There are some mistakes in the production, some clunky editing, some wobbly acting moments, and it overcomes all of them. Older teens would love this film and it offers some real scares and major mind games. Well done! Whoever you are. An un necessary gruesome remake almost seems inevitable once Hollywood sees this and decides to make it more explicit and simple.",Directional Techniques,Visual Effect,

Great use of silent sequences, close ups, slow motion, black humor, and mood lighting, Hitch's most underrated talkie (Easy Virtue is is most underrated silent film), this murder mystery offers all kinds of plot twists and sly humor even though you know the outcome long before it unspools. It's irrelevent. Fun all the way, including the opening theatre curtain and the closing one (thump). Dietrich is a splendid bitch, and this may be the best performance Wyman ever gave. Also look for Everley Gregg, Patricia Hitchcock, Miles Malleson and Ballard Berkeley. Dietrich's final close up and the coach scene with Wyman and Todd are gems.

I had to find out what decisions each person would make and the impact it would have on their lives. I really wish more of the character's back story would have been more drawn out and not shown in flashbacks that seem to last milliseconds. I'd like to have know the very moment Gary first picked up that needle, the day he and Fran split and more about Fat Kurt's past. The short flashbacks didn't do the story justice. Tears filled my eyes as the ultimate fate of Gary was revealed. The man had so much going for him at one time and could have very likely had a lot going for him again. He showed all the signs of wanting to give up the life, yet he did not. Just like the rest of the miniseries, this made me very sad.",Plot,,

This film could have been a hit for Clint Eastwood or John Wayne but Presley...no way. Presley sings only the title song and only a fan with more time on his hands than brain power could sit through the first 30 minutes. Presley was showing obvious signs of extreme boredom during this film and you can tell his movie contracts were close to being finished. The unshaven, dirty western appearance of Presley was not tolerated by fans in 1969 and fans have not changed, So even from the biggest fan, Charro does not come with a recommendation.",Plot,,
"Dreary action vehicle for Sylvester Stallone is a bone-crushing bore. Here he portrays...oh, who cares? It is basically the same riff he had done in the majority of his films. A dour Sharon Stone is on-hand as an enigmatic woman who coerces bomb expert Stallone into assassinating the Mafia clan that killed her family. Rod Steiger offers yet another horrible example of overacting as the head of the gangster family. In a ludicrous move, Eric Roberts portrays the assassin responsible for killing Stone's family when she was a little girl. Now an adult, she is playing up to him for revenge. Of course, there is only a two-year age difference between the actors and the film seems to be trying to convince us that there is a huge age difference. The opening scenes are basically a series of phone calls between the leads. You know the film is in trouble when Stallone's lasagna lips render a good portion of the crummy dialog unintelligible and Stone responds by remarking how much she likes his voice. Stallone purportedly campaigned to cast Stone as the lead, but someone forgot to write her a role. She spends the majority of the film as eye candy, cowering or being pulled around, pretty much like a traditional action heroine. There is nothing for her to sink her teeth into. There is a steamy shower scene near the midway point which deftly showcases the daunting physiques of the stars, but other than that there is literally nothing else to recommend the film in the slightest. Oh yeah, James Woods is also in the film, but charitable audiences may do him a favor and forget he was even in it.",Performance,Directional Techniques,

"This is a voice of a person, who just finished watching the second season of Rome, almost at one go, and grabbed the opportunity to see ""what happened next"" - this film conveniently takes off where Rome ends. If you find Rome an abomination, a foul mouthed screw-fest of little historical accuracy, then you might enjoy Imperium: Augustus. But, if you feel Rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the complicated intrigue, the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors, then Imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid, superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors.<br /><br />There are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in Rome. I especially disliked Rome's image of Cleopatra as a drug-soaked sex addict. There must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman, and the actress in Imperium suits the part much better. O'Toole and Rampling are good, and so are some others. But then... If you have come to know - and love - Atia as the super cool bitch, you'll find the depiction of her in Imperium - as a tear-jerking mother goose in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. There are supposed to be some bitchy characters in Imperium, but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more. You'll find no interesting female characters in this epic. There's also the painfully comic Maecenas, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he's once referred to as ""being effeminate in his pleasures"" in the annals).<br /><br />The interiors are rather meager and rely on clichés upon clichés. Cleopatra's big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children's play room in an Egyptian theme park. There's a looooooooot of really poor 3D graphics, not up to 2003 standards.<br /><br />The action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged Augustus is reliving. So we get a quick look at some historical events, some of which are presented well, whereas some are not. An disproportional amount of time is wasted to show Livia as the ""eternal flame"" of Augustus. This affair doesn't sizzle for even a moment, the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear-inducing musical score. Whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture, every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing (most of the actors are non English speakers).<br /><br />Everything is lukewarm in this epic. True, there are more historical accuracies than in Rome, but dramatically speaking, it's plain boring. The characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness. Camera-work is often reduced to static shots, and lighting offers nothing to please your eye.<br /><br />There's really no-one to love and no-one to hate in Imperium. Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome, there are much better films and miniseries around. Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire would be one thing I recommend.",Performance,Music,

It's quite obvious from this that they're not intending to film the other two books or at least not in a way that will have anything at all to do with them.<br /><br />As rushed as it all felt it was really painful to sit through from quite early on.

At some points, however, I felt like the kids were almost unbelieveable as angsty teenagers. The plot seemed a little disjointed too; Vlad's character continually reveals more complexity and conflict up until the very end, and I felt like I was just getting to know him when the movie finishes.

"I have to admit it. The Fly is the only David Cronenberg movie I have ever seen. I haven't seen any of his others, such as The Dead Zone, Naked Lunch, or eXiStenZ (I think that's how you spell it). But it's just an example that you don't have to be a Cronenberg fan to enjoy this classic. The movie was definitely not a horror movie starring a mad scientist who transforms into an evil fly. It's really not even a horror movie. It's a drama with amounts of romance and suspense/horror. Jeff Goldblum did the best performance of his career as Seth Brundle, a scientist who has invented something he calls ""Telepods"". They're pods that transport you from pod to pod, space to space. He tests this invention with animals and objects until one night he gets very mad because he believes his girlfriend (Geena Davis) is seeing someone else (John Getz), even though his belief is wrong. He tries the pods out for himself, unknowing that a fly got trapped in the pod with him. The pods splice them together, and slowly throughout the movie, Seth Brundle transforms into a gross and devastating creature, half man, half fly.<br /><br />The movie had no errors in it. The acting was great, the terrifying score by Howard Shore was amazing, the directing was exceptional, the story was brilliant, and the extremely sick and disgusting special effects were fantastic. Go see this movie! But don't go on a full stomach, unless you want to lose that meal in you.",Directional Techniques,Plot,
"- Reena the Seer (Monique Gabrielle) seeks the assistance of Deathstalker (John Terlesky) for a perilous journey. Deathstalker doesn't know that Reena is really Princess Evie in disguise. Reena/Evie is looking for someone to help her overthrow Jarek the Sorcerer (John Lazar) who previously overthrew her. The journey is full of obstacles - a murderous band of cut-throats, zombies, and an Amazon army. Of course the pair finally reach their destination for the final face-off with Jarek.<br /><br />- Deathstalker II is just one in a long line of movies that were made to cash-in on the success of Conan the Barbarian. I realize that most of this movie is played for laughs. But most of the jokes are anything but funny. Deathstalker II rips-off so many other movies, but does so with very little success. Take the exchange between Deathstalker and evil Sultana (Toni Naples) - Deathstalker, ""Do you expect me to talk?"" - Sultana, ""No, Deathstalker. I expect you to die."" It's moments like this that left me cringing.<br /><br />- The acting is, for the most part, exactly what you would expect. Gabrielle delivers her lines with the conviction usually reserved for kindergarten plays. But, something tells me that Gabrielle wasn't hired for the role because of her ability as a thespian. Terlesky comes off as the kind of guy you just want to slap for being such a smart aleck. Lazar, looking like a Duran Duran wannbe, is anything but menacing. Naples, for whatever reason, plays her role in a mostly straight fashion that doesn't fit with the rest of the nonsense going on.<br /><br />- If your interested in a history lesson covering the type of movies Conan the Barbarian spawned or if you like overly obvious attempts at humor, Deathstalker II may be the movie for you.",Plot,,
Is this movie ever horrifyingly awful. The first one was absolutely great and I can't believe they bothered with this and thought they could pass it off as a DTM movie. Don Rickles sucks as an actor and sucks even worse as Mr. Wilson. The kid playing Dennis is atrocious as him and this movie is just so over the top fake and unrealistic beyond forgiveness. It is already a very short movie and the length it is is already too long. To say it's not as good as the first is so far beyond an understatement it's ridiculous. Stay as far away from this piece of puke as humanly possible. Giving it a 2 is already being quite generous and that's right near the absolute bottom.,Performance,,
"That is what this movie is. Good God the special effects suck in this movie. It is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. Let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.<br /><br />First, there is the plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. Then all five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see is started by some guy dumping tons of gas all over the forest. All they show us is his boots, and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires. Meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape the fire, only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while they were speeding through the forest on dirt bikes!), dump gas all over the area they were riding through, and start more fires. He does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and starts him on fire. I won't spoil the ending, but this guy's resilience will have you shouting ""WHAT THE BLOODY HELL?!?!"" at the screen. Anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with methane gas. Yes, methane gas. I'm not even going to try to describe the ending, because it is too ridiculous, and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming. Which you won't, because you can't possibly expect what happens. This is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency.<br /><br />Is some semblance of consistence too much to ask for? Apparently so. I cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes). I think each character breaks at least one limb, and several more than one. They then limp around until the scene ends, and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs. There is one scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start dancing. But then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to.<br /><br />Finally, the CGI. If there is a hell, it consists of watching the fire in this movie. All they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with CGI fire. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is along the paths, and all of the trees more than two feet from the path are left untouched. And then they zoom out and show the whole forest being engulfed in flames. It's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but I assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive.<br /><br />This movie is one of those so-bad-its-good types. There are some occasions where it descends into the painful-bad category, but for the most part it stays above the line and is laughably inept. I can't wait to check out the other Nature Unleashed movies that came in the four-pack with this one.",Visual Effect,Plot,

"I wouldn't call this a screwball comedy, though. It stars out with Fredric March as a reporter who is demoted because his last story was a fake. He convinces his boss, played by Walter Connolly who always seems to play these kind of roles, to make a bigger story out of a woman dying of radium poisoning. He takes her to New York and show her a good time until she dies. But it turns out she isn't dying and she wants to tell March but her doctor won't let her or something like that. This movie is pretty short at only 75 minutes and it could of been longer. Fredric March is great as the reporter and Carole Lombard is also good as the woman who is faking her illness.

"One of the best movies so far of 2004 and that I have ever seen is Hidalgo. I loved it so much. The story was great and the acting and everything. Ever since I was 6 years old (now i'm 15) I loved Viggo Mortensen as an actor, poetry writer, etc..... and i still do love him. I think he is incredible at everything he does or at least tries. What I liked about Hidalgo was the bond Frank T. Hopkins had with his horse Hidalgo. I also liked the humor here and there. I think no one else could of played Frank T. Hopkins like Viggo can. This movie is one I will recommend for everyone to see. It is just great. Hidalgo has also given me a love for horses more than I had before.

"This was the first film written and directed by M. Night Shyalaman, who would go on to make a film called ""The Sixth Sense"" a few years later. They're not exactly the same genre of movie, but they both have a very similar feel to them, in both dialogue and overall tone & pacing.<br /><br />This movie was a lot of fun to watch, and worth the rent, if you can dig it out of the children's section at your local video store (it's rated PG). Good performances from all, with maybe only 1 or 2 scenes giving themselves away, something ""The Sixth Sense"" wasn't guilty of at all.<br /><br />That said, it's worth something as a milestone, as well... compare the early works of David Fincher or even Ron Howard, and notice how they got better as they went along, making more movies. This movie is a solid B+, with The Sixth Sense being the obvious A. We can only guess what ""Unbreakable"" may hold for us.<br /><br />Great actors and writing in this one, regardless. It is very much the story of young Josh and his search for God, and is not at all a Rosie O'Donnell movie as you may have been led to believe. Well worth watching. Denis Leary never looked so nerdy.",Directional Techniques,Performance,
"This new Miss Marple must be intended for people who are deaf and absolutely clueless of Agatha Christie's books. Every character, every part of the plot, and the wonderful development of the mystery has been changed. What we get is an extremely loud, garishly filmed (in bright reds, yellows, ....eeek!!), MESS. The main characters of Jason Rafiel and Michael Rafiel have been changed of course. In keeping with this new series, their characters have been changed to make them German! Michael Rafiel's relationship as well as how he met Verity Hunt has been changed also to an untasty dish served cold. Enough to turn the stomach. The ""sisters"" who are pivotal to the plot, are now nuns.....real sisters in the Catholic Church sense. The wonderful Amanda Burton is such a good actress, but she's totally wasted here as one of the new characters of a Nun. Richard Grant, also a good actor, is also wasted as Miss Marple's nephew, Raymond. They now make Miss Marple's nephew into a comical, silly, womanizer. Gee, I almost forgot to talk about Miss Marple and her role in this dreadful crime (I'm talking about the series). Can you really believe Geraldine McEwan when she states, ""I am Nemesis,"" in this mystery? She twitters, twinkles her eyes and dithers around. It's really hard to pick out the worse of the lot in the new Miss Marple series, but this comes real close. I think ""Bertram's Hotel"" is the one that disappointed me most since it was my favorite book, with ""Nemesis"" as second. The scriptwriters, directors, set designers, everyone associated with this lousy series must have absolutely no sense of Christie's work. Believe me, you are NOT getting anything near to her impeccable mysteries.",Performance,,

This gets us as far as Wonderful Copenhagen -- The official slogan of the Danish capital city -- as one could come: Dogma stands for a dark realism, although the critique is more individual than social. And Mifume confirms the Dogma's ability to deal in an innovative way with as important matters as deviance, everyday's violence, or modern loneliness.",Directional Techniques,,
"I was delighted to see this at the rental store because I absolutely adore Norma Shearer and had yet to see this piece of work. Overall it was very nice, with extravagant costumes (This must have been high up on Liberace's top 100 list), good acting, and fantastic directing. The only thing I have a major problem with is the fact that the director tried to cram in too much of her life into the span of only 2 and a half hours. You first start the movie with Marie Antoinette finding out she is to be married to Louis the XVI, then during the film so much goes on that you sort of have a hard time keeping up with how much time has past in her life, until finally you get to the crucial part in the film where her and her husband are to be executed. I don't know much about her life so I honestly have no idea how much they left out, but as a regular film watcher, I found this piece to be just wonderful. Norma Shearer did such a great job near the end, when she was about to be beheaded. When Count Axel de Fersen comes down the stairs into her dungeon to bid her a final fairwell, you really get the feeling that she is just completely drained with all emotion by the simple look in her eyes. I must admit to shedding some tears during that scene. Another highly recommended film. 8/10",Performance,Plot,
"and just about everyone else. Who knew that deception, treachery, and revenge could be this tedious.<br /><br />Although the period production design is reasonable, this film suffers from lax direction and the presence of an `international cast', with the resultant mix of accents and acting styles.

But, the greatest problem with the film was the lack of chemistry between the two main characters. When they acted like they were together it wasn't believable, Baldwin particularly seeming the most uncomfortable out of the two.<br /><br />Another thing that seemed to confuse me about the film was...well to be blunt..how confusing it was!! One minute she was angry at him, a pure anger that would leave any female audience member chanting her on in a supportive manner. But then suddenly...the anger was gone and 'Archie' was able to act in the same (slightly patronising in my opinion) manner as before.<br /><br />OK, so final thought on this film is if you really like the actors and storyline give a go, certainly as this comment is only based on half of the film. For me personally, it lacked the potential that the storyline possessed and I hope that somebody else takes a shot at it.",Plot,,

The acting is decent and the directing is OK, but this does not save it from being extremely painful to watch, I would rather burn alive than see this piece of crap again.

Perry & Hayek are ok and cute at times, but the direction and script is really flat. There are times where I can see a joke working better in my own head than the way it is played out in this film. The presence of these two mini-stars are not enough to make the film work. The filmmakers seem to have been satisfied with just letting them be there and getting it over with. I saw this coming early in the movie. What's really bad is that the best parts happen in the last 15 minutes of the movie. There is a very funny scene with Perry trying to be the husband helping Hayek thru labor during a rain storm on a bridge.

I mean sure horror movies does have some weird or stupid plot lines but come on this was just retarded.<br /><br />The camera shots are so awful. Every time someone talked it zoomed into the person's face so the whole movie you see the camera on someones face as they talk no clever camera angles. The actors honestly could have shot the movie anywhere. All they had to do is look directly into a camera a read their lines and an editor just cut and splices their lines to make a conversation. The lighting of the movie is horrible. Like i said all you see the whole movie is the actors faces but majority of the time you only see half their face because the other half is just black or dark. If Jeff Thomas thought that was a cool thing to do he's just a retarded nerd. There are some scenes where its just all black and you really can't make out anything. Bad shots and lighting doesn't even compare to how bad the acting is. You could pick random people off the street and get better acting. These people in this film aren't just normal or bad actors.

When Sives fails to suicide, his description of the nothingness is the revocation of Jacob's dream of the glorious ladder to Heaven.

I am all for low budget, I am all for campy horrors, and I love the horror genre, this doesn't match ANYTHING!! It's not low budget, it's beyond amateur, we're talking a C minus in a high school film class. This was done like a joke or something and the fact that it got released on DVD is mind blowing and for the IMDb reviewer that said this was better than the remake of The Fog and should have been released in theaters needs their head examined!! Writer director David Cross who is a first timer when it comes to credentials, isn't necessarily to blame. The concept and plot is okay, even the filming (although done low budget) has it's pluses which saves this from me giving it a big fat ZERO!!

Jillian Byrnes who plays the Ghost hunter Laura Kove has the most redeemable acting qualities in the film but that's saying little to nothing. These people simply have no business trying to make a film. They are amateurs in the worst sense of the word. They simply have no talent. The film, despite it's literal 3 seconds of redeemable creepiness is a worthless, unredeemable pile of crap!! The fact that a sequel exists scares me more than the film. At this point I can't imagine ever finishing the first film let alone attempting a sequel.<br /><br />Everyone has a different opinion and that's what makes reviews and discussions about films so great. There are a lot of good reviews for this film but for me it was horrible trash and that's okay. To each their own. It's a little surprising to me, and then to have people say that this was watchable or even great and to talk down to previous entries in the horror genre is a little perplexing. Films like Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, even The Fog...sure they'll never win any acting or film making awards but they stand the test of time and have followings of hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions.

"In the first few centuries of our age, the roman world was in decay. In one hand there was wealth and abundance, in the other people were loosing their religion, their values and purpose of living. Collosseum games were a great part of people's interest -- some data indicates that, at some point, there were 170 days of games a year; that's 170 without work for citizens. Those who had power, had more interest in their orgies of eating and vomiting and their sexual perversities than in governing the people. Such is the image presented to us by roman poets of this period such as Juvenal.<br /><br />Today, we'd rather see a good violent film than to watch, say a film of Ingmar Bergman -- which would perhaps give us more insight about life and about our condition as emotional beings -- and football is taking over our lives. Back then, people's interests were about romantic novels about triangular love affairs. This is the plot of Fellini-Satyricon. The screen play is based upon a roman novel, Satyricon, which mocked about those romantic novels and turned them upside down, by presenting the triangular love affair between two men and a little boy. I don't remember the name of the roman author of this novel but I know part of the text was lost.<br /><br />It is not an action movie, nor narrative, it is purely pictorical. Fellini-Satyricon is the most striking depiction of roman decadence. It's not about historical facts, it's an image of what decadence can be.

There's this underlying synth-thingie that becomes more or less audible depending on what's being said. That may work in some cheezy horrorflick... but it really put me off this one. Sad but true.<br /><br />I found myself listening more to the ""crescendos"" of the music rather that what was being said. So.. i cannot honestly say that I've seen the movie.<br /><br />Am i being picky? mayhap, but since i could not get past the (sort of) music, there was little or no treasure for me in this one. :(",Music,,
"Saw this at Tribeca Film Festival in Spring 2007, and was absolutely floored. I walked out of the theater afterword amazed at what I'd seen and thrilled that such an amazing film existed and had been maintained by a tiny number of appreciators in such excellent quality for so long.<br /><br />The story is not the strong point of the movie. Rather, as with Terence Malick films, the story is just a starting point for the film, which is another beast entirely. What shines and carries the film from scene to scene is the cinematography. I didn't know if this was happened elsewhere at the time, but I didn't expect to see hand-held camera work in a 1959 Russian film, let alone the kind of early spinning, impossibly-filmed shot that appears early in the film. Later, there is a sequence that makes me long to know how they created the opportunity to film in such conditions.<br /><br />If you've read this far, you must track down this movie. My understanding is that Francis Coppola has a California archive maintain the only copy in the Americas, and that it's usually shown just one a year.",Directional Techniques,,
"This movie was not really worth my time. The previews made it look significantly more coherent and put together, but the plot lines in this movie are all over the place, and the weak music score does little to tie it all together. Meant to be inspirational, the movie comes off as silly and contrived, and in parts laughable. Too many characters, back stories, and side stories are introduced and left unattended. The love story between Lyla (Kerri Russel) and Louis (Jonathan Rys Myers) is passionless and boring. Freddy Highmore, as the title character, is frankly creepy throughout much of the movie. And since the movie revolves around music and the fact that August is a ""prodigy"", more effort should have been put into teaching the kid to look like he knew anything about music or conducting. The score for the movie is merely adequate, as is the entire movie itself.",Music,Performance,
"I haven't checked my reviews for all the other Crime Doctor films, so I hope I haven't said any of the rest of them were worst in the series. But, I think after finally seeing this film (the final one for me to see), I can safely say it's the worst. Now this doesn't mean it's a terrible film--heck, this is a generally nice B-movie series--but its standards are noticeably lower than the other films in the series.<br /><br />Warner Baxter returns as 'Dr. Ordway'--a psychiatrist who specializes in criminals and forensics. He's very much the smart and likable guy, though oddly, in this film he seems to be ""made of money""--throwing around money like a millionaire. He never did this in other Crime Doctor films and spends money haphazardly. Sure, it only amounts to $700--but that's a huge sum of money for 1945. In one case, he buys a painting by an unknown artist sight unseen for $200 and later in the film he pays a man $500 for information that he was willing to give Ordway for free!! I really think Ordway was the one who should have been consulting a psychiatrist!! However, this is only a minor gripe about the plot. The biggest problem I have is how confusing and convoluted it all was. Plus, in the end when you find out who the real murderer is, it really makes no sense at all--nor does his bizarre statue in the basement. In fact, the whole thing makes my brain hurt despite a good performance by Baxter despite being given a script written by pre-schoolers.",Plot,Performance,

"Sometimes one must wonder how some pieces of cinema could be allowed to see the light of day. The person responsible for this film should have tossed the original into the nearest wood-chipper. The film quality was terrible, the sound quality was worse, the plot was dull and the acting was shockingly terrible.In fact, the movie was so bad that it is worth a rent! Despite my vote (which this movie truly does deserve) I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. The effects aren't too shabby, and the lack of talent makes this movie laughable. After all, it isn't entirely the actors' faults that the writing was so terrible. The movie is so abominably lacking that it makes for a fun 93 minutes. My advise is to grab your friends, sit down in front of the television and prepare to laugh.",Others,,
"When I saw this movie, I thought that I had heard of every possible premise for a gross-out movie. I was wrong.<br /><br />In this gem of cinematography, a swarm of earthworms have begun eating humans in a small town. Yes, you heard me right, the antagonist of this movie is a swarm of killer earthworms. Why didn't someone come up this concept before you might ask, because its STUPID!! <br /><br />Where do I begin reviewing this masterpiece? It all begins when a storm knocks down some power lines, drawing all the earthworms in the area to the surface of the ground. I missed the part that explained why they begin eating people, but that is just what they do. That's pretty much it.<br /><br />The script is bad. The directing is difficult to follow, too many cut-aways to the worms takes away any surprise this film has to offer.<br /><br />The acting is horrendous. The director decided to go with Local Yokel actors, and it shows. Case in point, the bus driver in the very beginning of the movie, trust me it only goes down hill from there.<br /><br />To sum it all up, this movie boldly went where no other movie dared to go, and payed the price.

"I was young when I hired this movie classic and admit I was scared out of my wits! But many years on, I have grown to love what it is all about. In fact, I now laugh at what I guess I was so scared off. Gremlins are creatures that are meant to scare and humour the audience at the same time.<br /><br />Don't ever get it wet. Keep it away from bright light. And no matter how much it cries, no matter how much it begs...never, ever feed it after midnight. With these instructions, young Billy Peltzer takes possession of his new cuddly pet, a gift from his father. But Billy will get a whole lot more than he bargained for and the small quite town of Kingston Falls is in for a Christmas they will never forget! <br /><br />The first point I want to discuss about this movie is that of the great story behind it. It was very original and one that I liked. I enjoyed the idea of little menacing creatures causing havoc in an innocent little town, and the way that the Gremlins just take over. At the start of this film, the audience is aware that with the cute pet Gizmo (a Mogwai), comes much responsibility. I love the fact that there are three rules attached. If you break them, then all hell will break lose. It is an interesting concept and one I must say that worked. I feel that there has been some movies which have tried to copy the Gremlins concept which don't even come close. The Critters (and there sequels) for example, were a poor attempt in trying to follow on from the Gremlins.<br /><br />The human cast of Gremlins was a pretty good one. The well known person from the Gremlins for me is the gorgeous Phoebe Cates. Her character in this film is full of hurt and regret, which the audience I am sure feel sorry for, plus she also helps save the day. I recently saw her very first movie, Fast times at Ridgemont High. That was a one hell of a teenage film. Cates looked stunning in it as well. Playing the lead role of Billy Peltzer was Zach Galligan. Zach has hardly been heard of since the role of Billy in Gremlins (and the sequel). Yet I seem to ask myself the question, why? He was excellent in Gremlins and a good choice as the main character. I guess he has done some other movie which have been flops. This includes the 1994 comedy All Tied Up, starring the stunning Terri Hatcher.<br /><br />It's now time to talk about the real stars' of this show. Yes, those little green monsters. All credit needs to go to puppet makers in the Gremlins. These things' looked so real. Special comment needs to go to the creator of the Stripe' Gremlin. He was an amazing character. I want to say that the character of Gizmo was very restricted. We hardly ever see the whole animal. I liked him much more the second time around. The Gremlins is a movie that has so much happen in a little time. While these creatures remain Mogwais', they are quite harmless, but once they turn into the gruesome Gremlins they cause disaster after disaster. The scene in the school was quite satirical, with the Gremlin having his revenge on the school teacher. The only criticism of this scene is that we never actually find out what happens to that Gremlin. I guess he eventually meets up with whole group, but how does the viewing audience know this? <br /><br />Then we have the hilarious scene at the Peltzer household. The mother was quite game tackling those gruesome creatures. I love it when she blends one in the mixer and then fries one in the microwave. When Stripe escapes, he hurts the small town of Kingston Falls. The scene at the YMCA swimming pool was clever. Then when you see all the Gremlins walking into town you appreciate that they are not real. Then you have the pub scene where Kate is trapped serving all these mischievous characters, it was totally wild. Also the scene with the snow plough going through the Futterman's house was crazy and suits the Gremlins totally. By the end we see one of the great pieces of directing, seeing all the Gremlins in the cinema watching quite a tame film in Snow White. Plus the final battle between Billy and Stripe in the Supermarket. It is so clever to see the little Gremlin tackle Billy with a chainsaw and a bow and arrow. Plus we see the best scene with Gizmo here. He is driving a Barbie-doll car, which was cute. I wont describe the end, but I will say that it was quite gut wrenching.<br /><br />Credit must go to the director and producer of Gremlins. Steven Spielberg is a genius and one of the best producers in the business. His other movies which I have loved include E.T., The Goonies, and Jurassic Park. I also enjoyed the directing of Joe Dante. He was very inventive and takes us on a wild roller-coaster ride with the Gremlins. <br /><br />To say that the original Gremlins film is a favourite of mine is an understatement. This movie is full of cuteness, cleverness, mischievousness and intelligence, all rolled into one. I also remember the posters advertising the Gremlins in this country (Australia). It was a Gremlin peeking out of a toilet. When I saw that I just had to see it, even though I did get nightmares after doing so. So, if you're air conditioner goes on the fritz, or washing machine blows up, or your video recorder konks out, before you call the repairman, turn on all the lights and check under all the beds, cos you never can tell, there just might be a Gremlin in your house!<br /><br />Rating: 4 Stars or 9/10.<br /><br />",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
"When I went to the theater to see screwed I knew it would be a good film, with Dave Chappelle and Danny Devito, I also knew that since Norms previous feature film (Dirty Work) was hilarious and very well-written that this movie could not live up to it, and it doesn't but it is still a wonderful piece of work. Casting Sherman Hemsley gave this movie a little more life than it would have without him, going back to the whole Dirty Work thing, this movie recycles ideas from Dirty Work, the whole Revenge thing, but a whole new plot, which could've been funnier if only Danny Devito would've worked to his potential, which we have seen recently in such critically acclaimed but movies that bombed such as Man on the Moon.",Performance,,
"This is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed or appreciated on many levels separately, or all at once. The point is that it is very enjoyable at whatever level you take it.<br /><br />For me, it is a profoundly moving film. It combines the comedy and frivolousness of the best of French film, with the most poignant and touching tragedy. The title provides much of the fodder for thought. Toto (what does that name mean?) the Hero. (Hero?) What kind of hero? Do you admire his heroism? Is it misplaced? Is it an act of self-sacrifice or...something else... What is a ""hero""? Do we need them? Why? And where do they come from, what causes one man, a seemingly ordinary man, to perform an heroic act? Is he all of us? Is this potential inside us all?

"Somewhat decent movie, overall, but frustrating in it's questionnable plot devices, and overall storyline. Extremely well-acted by Michael Keaton. However, there seemed to be so much unexamined and unexplained that, in my opinion, took away from the movie overall.<br /><br />I don't know all the rental laws in California, but I found it preposterous that someone could plop themselves into an apartment, tear it to pieces, not pay the rent, and have the law on his side. I don't know precisely how this works, but I had the feeling this may have been an extreme example of ""renter's rights"". The cops and legal system in this movie all seemed to be behaving from some kind of alternate, backward universe. Living in California a few years ago, I had the misfortune to have to evict someone. I had the law on my side every step of the way, and was able to get this person out of the property without much trouble. In fact, I was able to have the person charged with vandalism for damage they had done. The cops and courts were all thoroughly on my side. What exactly was going on here? Where did Carter Hayes come from? What in the world was his story? How did he come to this level? He seemed to just show up on their doorstep, well-dressed and professional, and then basically go batty. Why not some further development of who he was, and where he came from? There was slight anecdotal hints, but he seemed to be just some mindless slug, allowed to drop into someone's life and wreak havoc in it. Michael Keaton was truly sinister and terrifying in this, and made something more of the character, but this could easily have been senseless.<br /><br />Too many questions, and too many events that strained credulity.",Others,,

Both male leads give good performances (I never doubted they were really friends, which is rare in a movie) and there were many funny moments, a lot of which came from Bonnie Hunt.

When the sign ""the end"" comes, you think that something is missing, it's not possible an ending like that, maybe the deadline are the only explanation for such a sudden end, when you're still waiting for something that justify the movie.<br /><br />The recreation of the seventies atmosphere is achieved, and the music helps to that goal.

"3 Walls: 7 out of 10: My first reaction was that Indian prisons are really nice. Honestly I went to a couple of sleep away camps in my youth and suffered more hardships than these prisoners. Sure the prison has sexual assault, loss of freedom and death but I am definitely sticking to my analogy.<br /><br />This is my first real Bollywood film and since there are no musical numbers or dancing or romance I am under the impression that the film isn't typical. This is straight forward human drama with very good dialogue and a surprisingly twisted and adult story.<br /><br />The film concerns three prisoners who are scheduled to hang. One is angry and proclaims his innocence, one refuses to accept guilt for his crime and the last is so racked with guilt he cannot wait for the noose to be drawn. Into their lives comes a female filmmaker with some baggage of her own.<br /><br />The movie is about the four characters interactions and how justice is eventually done despite long odds and corruption.

"As someone who was fortunate enough to be at the world premiere of Calendar Girls in September last year, and to have met Angela Baker (the inspiration for Julie Walters' character) on several occasions, I would like to say that this is an amazing true story beautifully realised on film.<br /><br />In real life the ""Girls"" are just as inspiring, funny and brave as you expect them to be. I think that it is important to remember that there is a very serious message underlying this film - the devastation that a disease like leukaemia (or lymphoma, which Angela's husband died from in real life) can wreak on a family.<br /><br />The charity that the original Calendar Girls donated to is the Leukaemia Research Fund, and I would encourage anyone who was moved by the film to seek them out and make a donation at www.lrf.org.uk.

In this he gives credible performance as a man too far over his head in debt. Dennis Hopper is his usual bad guy persona as the short-tempered crime boss.

Not to mention a cop on duty drinking, Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze, and a killer who videos his murders. That's actually all I remember.<br /><br />The film took place in Texas, had a few car chases, and a clichéd ending. Perhaps if one watches this film with their eyes closed - it might be good?

"A comedy filled with entertaining characters, Greedy fails to be a successful film due to a tedious plot.<br /><br />Dirty old selfish Joe is rich and his snivelling greedy relatives want his money, so far, so funny. However, the structure of Greedy is badly done. The film starts with one of Joe's greedy relatives, Carl and his family. It is a mistake to make us side and sympathise with them, if ultimately they are not important or developed. Worried they are going to lose out on their inheritance to sexy young nurse Molly, the bickering relatives call in long-lost nephew Danny, Uncle Joe's favourite. Although Michael J Fox is a welcome addition to any film, and his energy, wit and compassion make him a watchable lead, he is introduced too late to be this lead. Danny either isn't needed in this plot of greedy relatives versus evil old man, or it should start with and focus entirely on him. It is very difficult to care about his failed professional bowling career, as it is boring, and the sappy music that follows Danny and girlfriend Robin around is far too overdone.<br /><br />While child-Danny and Michael J Fox-Danny's impressions of Jimmy Durante are impressive, the need to show the audience who they are doing impressions of by starting the film with a lengthy clip of Jimmy Durante from Two Girls And A Sailor makes for a slow beginning that has little to do with the film.<br /><br />Molly is a badly written character. She knows Joe is perving on her, but she likes the lifestyle he provides and eventually she nearly sleeps with him for money, and yet she isn't supposed to be that sort of girl. Well, she clearly is. Also Olivia d'Abo is apparently English so it is confusing that her English accent is one of the fakest I have ever heard. Exactly what part of England is she from?<br /><br />The plot plays out pretty obviously, excluding Joe's insanely over the top ploy to discover who loves him, with bad people getting nothing and good people being rewarded, but it is the despicable Joe who has ruined his family's lives. Without him, they would never have become the people they are, so to see them end up with nothing, while he is still rich isn't satisfactory at all.<br /><br />Amusing characters suffer an irritatingly twisty plot, dominated by a detestable patriarch and are buried under too much moral for this film to be as funny as it wants to be. It should have stuck with the idea of relatives who will do anything for their inheritance and dumped the morals of Danny and manipulation of Joe, which just hinder the laughs.",Music,Plot,
"OK, sure the movie pretty much sucks, but it's definitely worth it to see some cool car chases if you are a car chase fan. After realizing how many precious classic Dodge Chargers were destroyed during the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" TV run, it's also kinda sad to see a hot '57 Chevy banged up in chases (watch the disappearing dents, they used more than one of course) but the highlight definitely is that great crash by the '57 through the roof (where of course, McNichol simply keeps driving after the car lands). This chase, with the '57 Chevy, just may be one of the greatest car chases ever put on film actually, it's just too bad it's in a comedy and not a 'serious' film. <br /><br />The comedy is definitely bad, with maybe the funniest scene probably being the truck driver who backs in McNichols' way in an alley, who says ""nooo!"" with a hilarious look on his face. So hey, pick this one up off ebay for the chases, and watch with the volume turned off when you can to avoid the painful dialogue.",Plot,,

"What a sad flop, with the best of intentions. The message to the viewer is overly clear, it shouts: this is an artistic, slow and sensuous movie, contrasting Oriental philosophy with Western greed for speed and immediate effects. Well, yes, we get this rather soon, and then we suffer through the rest Perhaps slow movies are not exact equivalents of slow food, after all. <br /><br />There are some redemptive traits, though. The film could be see as an illustration of Joyce Carol Oates's observation that ""prolonged happiness is a prison from which the self yearns to escape at any cost"". People cannot stand a prolonged happiness, and the protagonist says so much himself. <br /><br />Another (attempt at) redemption: perhaps the movie is about the temptations of Orientalism typical for the era portrayed: the Western men, bored to tears, looking for any kind of adventure that the exotic Orient could offer them. Because if it is a love story, it is Hélène's love story, but if so, it is underdeveloped. The other ""love story"" is too ridiculous even to consider.<br /><br />Finally: it is true that seeing it in with a full screen can help; I have watched it as DVD, and although it was a very good screen, it could not reproduce the immersion effect possible on a large screen only.",Others,,
"With just enough realism and surrealism, Coppola plays this documentary the way a documentary should be played - an individual with a vision and his attempt to push the limits of the envelope in post-WWII industrial America. The period costumes and music are excellent and accurate, the bittersweet punchline at the end is well done and just understated enough. The camera work is vivid in brilliant Technicolor as opposed to the black and white sometimes reserved for this time period. Frederic Forrest, Christian Slater and Joan Allen are all adequate and the gentle acting of Martin Landau complements Bridges frenzied portrayal. But the focus is always Jeff Bridges who carries Tucker's manic, obsessive, genius with amazing ease. Definitely one of my favorites.",Directional Techniques,Performance,

Taking that idea into account, I would have to say that ""Singapore Sling"" is without a doubt an indelible addition to the film noir genre, albeit the bizarro kind. As one of the reviewers has mentioned before, this movie shouldn't be taken seriously. You should come into this one with an open mind and you'll be rewarded with a beautifully photographed film noir filled with black humor. ""Singapore Sling"" is like the demented cousin of ""Laura"", ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Grey Gardens"". It's your basic detective story but with torture, bizarre erotica, and outstanding overacting.

"If it wasn't made by Kragh-Jacobsen I would be surprised.<br /><br />But there are not many directors who can make a movie about a child, a whole movie with one child as a hero, a main character, and avoid one of two possible traps: either make a (usually low-intelligent) movie for kids (and adults who can believe it) and turn hero to superhero who can solve all problems and beat everybody all alone, or make a movie where all tragedies have to happen to a single child so the target adult audience can fill the bucket by draining their tear glandes.<br /><br />Scandinavian authors are better than any others able to make a real movie about real children. They (as I wrote on another board) understand children as if they had invented them. Unfortunately, some modern, especially Danish movies suffer from Hollywoodization and though some can be good (like Klatretosen) they don't belong to the great tradition, they don't succeed the great movies from former decades.<br /><br />Kragh-Jacobsen is not a typical example, but among the best. ""Bird Street"" is not exception, he made several movies about children in very different situations, but in similar style: these movies are about kids, can be watched by kids, but mostly try to present real kids to adults. However, he became worldwide famous by ""Mifunes sidste sang"". It's not a surprise because many western countries avoid Scandinavian kids movies, because they are too different. British authors used to do something in this style (sometimes even in darker mood like Loach), American kids are too infantile (but still beat adults...), Italians are too mature (because of social context), Czechs forgot that they have children (and were among the best in 70's), so only French authors can stand next to Scandinavians. And these movies don't seem to have audience in USA, either for not being interesting (for kids), or even for being controversial (for adults). As USA creates an opinion in almost whole world, things that are not accepted there usually can't make international success, and are convicted to stay within local region.<br /><br />""Gummi Tarzan"" was one of the first movies which seriously admitted that bullying exists and is a problem. ""Skyggen af Emma"" (his best work in my opinion) strongly opposes modern world widespread paranoia that makes our lives miserable, almost worthless. In both movies kids are involved in different and firm interactions with other people.<br /><br />""Island on Bird Street"" is a one-actor movie like Spielberg's ""Duel"". Unlike some dark power personalized in Spielberg's truck driver this movie deals with a very recognizable, yet equally dark power of nazism. And, what some other comments declare to be a fault, I find to be brilliant: Alex is not a superhero. He didn't do much exceptional things. His biggest success was that he survived. He often simply had luck. There are no cartoon Culkin tricks: he is afraid, he hides as every normal kid would do, and sometimes when he seems to do something brave, it is more because of hopeless resignation. But in the same time he can still feel joy in small things and in spite of accelerated maturation he keeps the soul of child and his real age comes to surface whenever allowed by the circumstances.<br /><br />Two flaws: First, English language, and there is nothing to justify it. Second, the ending which is too false-romantic for reality (not fitting in harsh, cruel world of former 100 minutes)), and too vague if not realistic (being e.g. a dream in agony).<br /><br />Neither of it should give second thoughts to any of those who believe that kids are still kids, despite what modern society tries to make them to be or make us believe they are. And if you are this kind of person, probably your children are ready to watch it with you.",Directional Techniques,Plot,

Her sequence at the concert when we watch her face, as all the emotions are seen in her face, is one of her best moments in a film. Also the last sequence when we watch her at the beach, after she has married Joseph and is seen wandering in the water crying is another clue we get from her.<br /><br />Cameron Bright, the young actor, makes Sean comes to life, no pun intended. This young actor has an innate talent for getting inside the skin of the characters he is portraying. There is not a false move from the way this actor tackles to convey the idea he is Sean, and that's all there is to it!<br /><br />Anne Heche, as Clara, holds the key to solving the mystery of the situation the arrival of young Sean has created. The family is in turmoil. This well to do family, who is at odds, first believing, then seeing what it has gone to Anna. We don't see what Clara's role is in the story until the end. Her character has been made to seem ambiguous throughout the movie.<br /><br />Danny Huston, who we admired in his recent role in ""The Constant Gardener"", who plays Joseph, the man that has made Anna agree into marrying him. Joseph cannot deal with the changes Anna is going through, so he bolts from her life, as one expects him to do. It's bad enough to have been competing with the ghost of a dead former husband, but it's too much to have a ten year old rival.<br /><br />Laruen Bacall, Arliss Howard, Peter Stormore, and the others in the cast give good performances under Mr. Glazer's direction. <br /><br />The moody musical score by Alexandre Desplat is elegant, somber, and mysterious and sets a perfect mood for the film. The elegant cinematography by Harris Savides, with its dark tones and cloudy skies serves the film well. Ultimately, this film clearly shows us a director, Jonathan Glazer, who never bores the viewer in the always chooses the stories he wants to present for our pleasure.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
i enjoyed reading the books more than watching the same tired old animation by rankin bass...fine for kiddies but still below par animation...why they went back to this low grade animation after ralph bakshis fantastic animation in the lord of the rings beats me. and the voice-overs were done by the same people from the hobbit..i think they were way below the voice-overs in the lord of the rings movie .. the hobbit was neat in its time but the return of the king is an unfair adaptation of the remaining 11/2 books ...i heard they are making a live action version of the lord of the rings in 3 parts i hope they use generated effects for some of the characters because midgets arent the same as hobbits ...i look forward to seeing all 3 movies,Others,,
"For a TBS original series, I'd say its brilliant. Otherwise, I'd say its pretty damn good. The stories are well-thought out and executed, and already, having seen just a handful of episodes, I see some strong continuity.<br /><br />I caught the first episode in its first run and have seen subsequent episodes ""on demand"", which is a powerful tool for a late-night TBS series. One complaint I have is that I always wanna slap or yell at Leslie (John Lehr), but at the same time it adds to the draw of the show. As for the characters, I find them interesting and funny in their own ways. All in all, well-worth seeing.",Performance,,
"I never caught MTM when it was originally on. I didn't watch much television and the idea of a sitcom about a single woman had no interest to me. Then, after it was cancelled, a local TV station started showing two shows a night, back to back, and I started watching. At first I wasn't impressed. The early 70s fashions and hairstyles were horrific, the acting uneven, the topics dated and Moore occasionally overacted. But, as the series progressed, the writing got better, the cast got more comfortable with their roles and Moore toned it down a little. I still don't like the first season too much. It does introduce us to all the characters but it just seemed kind of forced. Also it was somewhat sexist. At one point Moore actually does Lou Grants' laundry! OK OK--his wife had left him but still... After the first season though the series picked up speed and just got better and better. It also showed a single woman living alone and liking it--a rarity for TV on those days. It even hinted that she had an off screen sex life. It also found humor in some taboo subjects. When Chuckles the Clown is inadvertently killed in one episode they actually made his death seem funny! Supposedly (according to Moores' autobiography)no one wanted to do it and some crew people were ""sick"" the week it was filmed. That episode went on the win a few Emmys and is considered a true classic. Also Moores' character got more liberated--especially during the last season. She got a steady boyfriend (Ted Bessell) and, at one point, gives him a long passionate kiss right in front of Lou Grant, Ted Baxter and Murray Slaughter. It all ends perfectly in the last episode. No one was killed but everybody (except for Ted Baxter) is fired and they all leave the office singing! A true classic of TV. Well worth seeing.",Performance,Plot,
"""Dennis the Menace"" is unique in its own way because it's observant. This movie made me laugh at stuff i've always laughed at and things i'd never thought I would laugh at. The film can be surprisingly innocent at times and sincere and heartwarming. And the kid who plays Dennis is a way better actor than Macaulay Culkin. I liked the film for its imagination and humor. A good film. I also liked how they showed Dennis trying to resist the temptation to do something bad but can't resist.",Performance,,

Rebecca Demornay is so cool in this movie, she's pretty and kicks butt at the same time.<br /><br />Rebecca Demornay and Mary Gross are the only female cadets at the FBI academy, but they team up and show their male colleagues how it's done. The two characters work so well together, it's buddy comedy at it's best.<br /><br />The movie has got many funny parts, that make you laugh even if you have already seen them a thousand times. Like the scene when Demornay puts the cuffs on her uncooperative arrest-practice partner after sweeping him off his feet. Running gag of the movie is ""the kick in the balls"" which they also use in a hilarious scene to take out some amateurish muggers.<br /><br />But rather see it yourself, once you've watched you'll want to see it again.",Performance,Plot,
"Well, if so, have I got a film for you! Actually, even you won't like it. Because this movie is bad. Not bad like week old milk, bad like genocide. Bad like finding out that everyone you have ever loved was murdered by your dog because you gave it rabies. Bad like the Hantavirus.<br /><br />I hope that gives you an idea of what I'm talking about. I can deal with crappy movies. I can watch underworld 2, so I'm pretty immune to it, but this movie takes crap to a whole new level. First off, the ""Main Characters"" are mentally deficient ex-porn actresses who happen to ride motorcycles. Or rock climb. Or, I don't know, flirt with each other. That's all they really seem to do. They meet and become fast friends. Then these 90 pound girls insult some bikers. ""Action"" ensues. Basically, you find out that these girls will steal money, but not motorcycles, because they walk to a hotel. From there they spend the rest of the movie with pretty much no clothes on.<br /><br />There is horror in this movie, but it's more from the realization that those hillbillies from the beginning were probably related then from the actual story. There is an escaped blah blah blah, evil, blah, scary, blah, probably cries himself to sleep at night. He has a bad nickname. He kills with axes, or whatever is presented to him. He survives being hit by a car. He is just big. That's how scary he is. Big. Right.<br /><br />So, he chases them, they try to get some money from some bar tenders and hillbillies, they run from bikers. A cop sleeps with a councilor while she leaves the kids at home. All while being painfully aware of their own level of incredible cheese. The actors, minus that one guy who you kind of recognize, are not actors at all. They are the retarded droppings of a Los Angeles nightclub; in other words, they all worked in the ""Independent Film"" industry before this. Or, at least, they wish they had the talent to work in the ""Independent Film"" industry. They are so bad.<br /><br />Combine this with some of the most horrible script, directing, ""music"", and action scenes ever created, along with the fact that the story is complete tripe, and you get one of the worst movies ever made. Ever. In the entire history of movies. Do not watch it. Do not look at it.

"Aspen Extreme falls into the rare class of movies that gets worse with every scene. Literally, the first scene of this movie is the best one and it just falls off a cliff from there. Be warned though, that first scene really isn't very good. The dialogue and plot are poor. The acting belongs on the lifetime channel. If this movie is what extreme skiers do, then I'll stick to my day job. This looks to be good material for a 'bad movie' night with the guys, but its bad is boring. Also, how in the world can two skiers from 'hills' in Michigan be pro skiers on terrain they have never skied before arriving to try out to be ski instructors. I'm not an expert skier, but I know the hills here in Arizona are more extreme than those in Michigan.",Plot,Visual Effect,
"This series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here. There's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual. At times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the ""cub,"" who nearly gets lost early on. All in all, disappointment.<br /><br />That said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.",Others,,

The comedy is far better than that of the over-acclaimed Napolian Dynamite, I recommend trying to find this at a local theater. Its showing in Rochester NY at the end of June.

I fall in love with her everytime she's seen on screen... and this movie is no exception.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast; they're great!! Although Joan Crawfords character is a bit anonymous.

I am lucky that I saw this freak show on a readmission ticket, so I didn't give the whack jobs in charge a penny. So, in summary, if you want to go spend nine dollars to be able to sit in an empty theatre, then this is the flick for you. Please, don't waste your money (and time).

"This is a difficult film to review as it's really the first of it's type. Using only computer graphics, it attempts to create real looking and believable characters in a futuristic Anime setting. Unlike 'Toy Story' and it's followers, this movie isn't trying to look like a cartoon, but like a live action film with human actors.<br /><br />Considering it from this point of view, it's a stunning achievement. At times I found myself forgetting I was watching computer graphics - it really is that well done. The level of detail in the faces and the character movement is especially impressive, although at times it didn't feel quite right (on a few rare occasions it looked quite bad.) <br /><br />If we look at the film aside from the technical achievement, it doesn't fare as well. The plot is very Japanese influenced which is a good thing. We're saturated by American movies and it's refreshing to see something off beat. Unfortunately it feels watered down, as if it's Japanese origins have been diluted by American influence. As a result it ends up being neither Japanese Anime or American Sci-Fi Action - I would have liked it to have been a bit more way out, a bit more daring. <br /><br />Like the plot, the acting is weak. Facial expressions are extremely important in conveying feelings and the technology isn't quite there. The voice acting was good but it's difficult to empathise with the characters.<br /><br />I'd talk about the sets and costumes etc - but there weren't any right?<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a film I'd recommend to everyone.

Forgettable Disney product with the expected slapstick interludes is well-made, if not fresh. OK performances by Dean Jones, Yvette Mimieux and wily Maurice Chevalier (in his final film), but the argument at the center of the story isn't expanded upon, and the romance which sketchily develops between Dean and Yvette seems like an afterthought as well.

The plot is you're standard 'couple stumble across wads of cash and go on the run'. There's nothing new in this story but that is not what makes it a bad film.<br /><br />What makes this cringe-worthy viewing is the absolutely sloppy writing. The characters (all of them) are made to do such stupid things like leaving bags of cash wide open for all to see, not once, not twice, not thrice...And other things like buying a massively conspicuous getaway car, not locking a car with wads of cash in it. Our heroine in a maid's uniform with a massive and fresh gash on her head allowed to walk past a Police checkpoint who are on the look out for such a person.The list is absolutely endless, and there's even an apparently abandoned but fully functioning, rust and dereliction free power plant.<br /><br />I had given this 3/10 but now that I've written about it I realise that is too generous 2 is all it's worth despite the odd amusing reference to True Romance that has been slipped in.",Plot,Directional Techniques,

Anyone that would stay around someone like him for more than 10 seconds would see how much of an a-hole he is. It's just so ""in your face"" that it hurts.<br /><br />William Scott plays some guy that was abused by this teacher and, later on, writes a book about letting go of the past.

I think this is supposed to make fun of all those people that believe this kind of books are of any help to anyone, let alone change one's life. Everyone that says the book changed their lives in the film is a loser.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon is almost invisible in the action of the movie, even though her relationship with Woodcock (now that's a name!) is the trigger for the storm that follows. Note: I mean invisible as in not interesting, mediocre, just plain stupid role.<br /><br />I expected more from the end, but then I just realized: this film looks like it's written by a crazy, emotional cripple gym teacher. Throughout the plot, all of Farley's fans are losers and all those that ""succeeded"" in life are grateful for the humiliation they were subjected to during gym classes. The film ends as John Farley agrees with his teacher's methods and thanks him for the bad way he was treated in school. Although giving up in such a pitiful way has nothing to do with having a backbone, John writes a new book called ""Backbone"". o.0 Conclusion? It's boring, not interesting, not good and certainly annoying. The only funny things about this film are the gags, and those are mediocre as well. So don't go see it in a theater and don't rent it.

"McElwee has done many other similar works, some more deeply moving -- the one about his father the doctor, for instance. But this gives a great introduction to his ""style"" -- the guy who takes the camera everywhere and films his life, and not just in trivial ways -- ala web cams today. A tribute to women -- and women rate it much higher than men, as the imDb voting demographics show. This pre-dated the well-known and wildly successful ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" -- some would call it an outright steal or rip-off of ""Sherman's March."" As far as I know, McElwee had nothing to do with and is not credited in ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape. ""Sherman's March"" clearly influenced ""SL & V,"" to put things more mildly. SL&V has marketing written all over it, from the title to the stars (admittedly not as famous during the time of the shoot as now), and in its focus on sex and masturbation, particularly. ""Sherman's March"" has indie-film written all over it; it's not about stars, only indirectly about sex, and everyone plays themselves: it's a documentary. I liked all of that and it was a fresh approach when it first came out. Most such films are not done skillfully, thoughtfully, or edited well enough to make for excellent viewing. You may or may not like McElwee personally; he's a bit of an odd-ball, but a kindly one. His women friends are the focus here, however, and he wisely gets out of the way most of the time.

I found Hurt's portrayal of mad Caligula to be a multi-dimensional masterpiece, filled with terrifying nuance. Watching him you never know when the next head will fall, or if he's suddenly touched with sentiment and decides to spare some perceived slighter. Particularly profound is the scene in the tent with Claudius where he seriously, and with an almost profound regret asks Claudius if he is indeed mad. Certainly Caligula is portrayed as a madman always on the verge of some tyrannical rage and concurrent action but he is still very recognizably a multi-leveled character in the hands of the superb acting of an often overlooked great actor John Hurt.

Even Sandra Bullock is amusing, especially when giving a colonic. This is a movie that looks like it was fun to make, and it can be just as fun to watch.

A father and son travel around the world making a film about other fathers and sons that they find along the way. The interviews illustrate the dynamics of the relationships between fathers and sons and are often touching and enlightening.<br /><br />There is some sentiment and tenderness in this film so not every person (especially male) may be comfortable with all of it--but it doesn't venture into the arena of being a coerced trip down saccharine (artificial sweetener) lane.<br /><br />According to the filmmakers (on the commentary track of the DVD) they didn't coach the people in the documentary to say anything specific about their father or sons. Most fathers and sons just seemed to want to use their interview as a vehicle for expressing things they were not normally permitted to say or express. A lot of the power of this movie comes from the sense of personal meaning that these fathers and sons bring to each other and that we're allowed to watch.,Plot,,

The sequence in which initial victim Teresa (Margaret Landry) is obliged to walk through a tunnel under a train overpass is completely unnerving.

And in the end, there's a bit of meditation on how people sometimes try to hide their feelings and fears behind a show of coolness and imperturbability.<br /><br />This is well worth catching for any fan of the classic style horror movies.

"Spoiler: sort of.....<br /><br />I was okay with this film until about the 20 minute mark when the autistic boy starts playing with his own feces. And it's not just one quick scene either. It carries on through a sequence that lasts a good five minutes. <br /><br />I'm just not that dedicated to Australian cinema.<br /><br />And even if you take that scene out, this thing really doesn't come across as a good advertisement for Australian film. It's the same old story we always see about a quaint little family drama that fundamentally bores the living day lights out of anyone who isn't Megan Spencer.",Others,,
"I laughed once during this movie, when Dr. Meecham (Howard Duff) - heading to the basement of the mansion as the powerful storm strikes - says ""It's like the last 10 days of Hitler!"" Perhaps, although I think the last 10 days in Hitler's bunker were probably more interesting. ""A Wedding"" isn't a bad movie. In a strictly voyeuristic sort of way it's even mildly interesting. The title explains everything. The whole movie is about the wedding of Dino and Muffin (Desi Arnaz, Jr. & Amy Stryker) and the reception that follows at the groom's home. The two families don't mix well, and the movie basically portrays their interactions. There's no real consistent plot to the story; just the account of the two families mixing. There's the senile bishop who conducts the wedding, the death of the family matriarch, an unexpected pregnancy and an unexpected love at first sight moment, but there really wasn't any one central point here. Neither was there anyone who stood out to me as being the real star of the movie. This was definitely an ensemble cast, with Carol Burnett as the bride's mother being probably the best known, and a variety of other actors and actresses who, in years to come, would become better known (Pam Dawber, Mia Farrow, and Dennis Franz leap to mind.) There's a very small role for the famous Lillian Gish as the matriarch who dies near the start of the movie (although her body stays front and centre through the movie.) In general, the performances were all pretty decent. The movie is too long, with a running time of a bit over 2 hours, and while the first hour seemed pretty well paced, the whole concept got a bit tired after that. 4/10",Performance,Plot,
"Something I often find bothersome in 'time travel fiction' is that there is usually a large chunk of the storytelling dedicated to the tedium of explaining 'how' time travel works, particularly when time travel is merely a device to aid the storytelling. We don't really need to know the science behind it because, simply put, science can neither logically explain its paradoxical nature, nor prove or dispute its possibility. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" never makes pretenses to the science behind it, rather it centers its focus on the story.<br /><br />At the heart of this film is a love story and the complexities that people bring to their relationships. What I liked most was its metaphorical allusion to the distance in relationships and how the important people in our lives stay with us even after they are gone. The scenes between Henry and young Clare were especially moving because they took literally the notion of feeling like you have known someone your whole life. It's kind of like when you share stories from your past with friends and significant others, retelling them time and again until your experiences are indistinguishable from theirs, except in the case of Henry and Clare, the experiences are real if not linear.<br /><br />Just go and watch it. Decide for yourself if you like it. Just don't dwell too much on the technicalities. After all, Scientific Theorists have been slamming their heads against the wall on the matter of time travel for centuries. Take the story for what it is and enjoy the ride.",Plot,,
"The combination of director Danny Boyle, writer Alex Garland and actor Cillian Murphy should have meant that Sunshine was the best film of the year so far. Sadly it's meaningless drivel.<br /><br />There are two kinds of space movie. The first are those with shooting and/or aliens (Star Wars, Serenity, Alien etc). Then there are those in which the focus of the film is on people going mad in space for no well explained reason (Solaris, 2001, Silent Running etc). Sunshine falls into the latter category. If you've knowingly seen a Tarkofsky film then go and see Sunshine - you're bound to be able to find some spurious justification for why it was meaningful.<br /><br />*Spoiler*<br /><br />A group of ethnically diverse astronauts are in the final leg of the second and last mission to chuck a cosmic paint can into the sun in an attempt to ""restart"" it. <br /><br />Nothing much happens until the crew discovers that the ship from the first mission is still orbiting the sun.

This surviving loony has a god-complex, a bad case of sunburn and the ability to blur film. He kills everyone except Cillian Murphy who manages to detonate the bomb and everyone on earth is saved - hooray.<br /><br />Apparently: <br /><br />1) Sentient super computers aren't very good at providing useful information such as ""there's an extra person on board"" or ""shall we make sure the mirrors are adjusted before turning the ship?"". <br /><br />2) Vitally irreplaceable sections of space ships often explode and/or catch fire for no reason. Providing backup systems (or even fire extinguishers) is apparently pointless and unnecessary. <br /><br />3) Computers that rely on complex liquid cooling devices to function do not require emergency shut offs. Or spares. <br /><br />4) Gold lame space suits are in. <br /><br />5) All derelict space ships should be investigated in case they contain plot devices. <br /><br />6) If the sun is going out restarting it will be a doddle.<br /><br />*End Spoiler*<br /><br />There are some people who may decide this is THE in thing.

"Screamers impressed the heck out of me. Reviews I'd read of it called it a ""slasher"" movie and said that it was highly derivative of other movies, such as Aliens and Blade Runner.<br /><br />In fact, I found it to be highly imaginative and original, very much in the spirit of the Philip K. Dick story that inspired it, pondering the ultimate meanings of humanity, war and technology. The scenery and story surrounding the film were both intriguing: despite the film's low budget, the director did an excellent job of constructing the devastated planet. Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin turned in excellent performances, and the supporting cast was also quite good. Finally, every scene is shot with a real urgency to it; particularly well done are the nightmarish confrontation 2/3 of the way through the movie and the poignant and shattering ending. In short, this is a very very good movie and well worth renting. It will stay with you for quite a while.<br /><br />Before signing off, I should say something about construing one science fiction movie as a ripoff of others. Screamers had elements of its plot which can be found in other films (ie men and machines, monsters) but it blends them seamlessly into its own original story. The mere presence of identifiable elements from other films has given people ground to criticize this movie as unoriginal. By their standards, I don't think it would be possible at all to make new movies or novels or anything. These surface similarities will always be there. One can argue that the Matrix is merely an update of Socrates' cave allegory. In conclusion: ignore the critics and see Screamers!!",Performance,,
"Well, I confess I did not read the book. And, as a person who retched at every one of Margaret O'Brian's performances, avoided that movie. Sooo, I watched the 1994 version basically ignorant of who and what should have been.<br /><br />The colors and historic feel of the film are wonderful. I am still pondering, however, the fact that Amy had quite a growth spurt and the rest of the family stayed physically the same. Wynona Rider never changed physically or emotionally.<br /><br />And let's be honest, Claire Daines stunk (stank?). She was a Concord Madonna if there ever was one, born to be martyred. Boring! What an insipid nonentity! And here's a question; why didn't the father TALK? He was just furniture who hung around.

You can see a bit of your self in all the characters, and William is non stop funny as a momma-loving, republican, success oriented lawyer.<br /><br />There are other characters that you learn to enjoy, but the friendships between these women is stronger than anything thrown at them; including man troubles.",Plot,,
"Having always loved his knockout performance as the egoticstical producer in ""The Band Wagon"" and being familiar with his recordings I watched this latterday Jack Buchanan movie with great expectation. A parody of the Johnny Ray type celebrity it's based on a long running stage show that also starred Buchanan. The idea itself isn't bad and with the right handling it could've been a British equivelent of ""The Girl Can't Help it"" (it even features Britain's own blond bombshell - Diana Dors, in a cameo) But the satire is limp, and J Lee Thompson is far more at home in gritty thrillers than froth like this. What we end up with is a silly (in the annoying sense) witless piece typical of the mediocre stuff Rank was churning out in the 50's.<br /><br />The film is dominated by constant mugging and bad performances (the teeth grindingly unfunny psychiatrist rates special mention) clumsy slapstick (Joan Sims repeatedly swooning whenever she sees the singer, Buchanan falling into a fish pool, or falling onto a trampoline, or repeatedly getting his hat pressed down over his eyes etc.) This might sound mildly amusing and maybe it was back in the 50's but now the whole thing is so predictable and laboured, with most gags being repeated ad nauseum that the only reaction is to groan. Furthermore it's a musical of sorts and our (minimal) enjoyment is dampened by some tedious songs. Of these only ""Cry"" hit's the mark being exactly the type of song Johnny Ray would've sung and this provides the sole amusing scene in the film when a slightly drunk Buchanan decides to have a crack. Apparently this was a real show stopper on stage. Here it's a brief chance for Buchanan to shine and he milks it for all it's worth.<br /><br />By the last 5 minutes I was longing to fast forward this particular turkey when out of the blue the film gave us a few minutes of vintage Jack, in a brief song and dance number after all the plot points were been resolved.<br /><br />If the whole movie had been like this few minutes of good humoured hoofing from a guy who knew how, then it would've been a very pleasant experience indeed. Unfortunately it isn't and although everyone tries hard (too hard) it's a laboured piece and unworthy of it's star.",Performance,Music,
"Swimming Pool contained good symbolism, acting, and especially great cinematography. The movie was really too slow for me for the first 70 mintues, however, and I kept wondering, what is the point of painting us a pictures of this dour and unhappy author's interactions with a lustful irresponsible bratty young woman? Although I admired the character portrayal and felt the movie visually artistic and even brilliant at times, I was not emotionally invested in Sarah Morton enough nor in Julie's to care. However, the ending changed all of that.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS BELOW!***<br /><br />The twist at the end reminded me of Fight Club and and Sixth Sense, where all of a sudden the viewer realizes he percieved everything through the wrong lens. When the twist reveals that the Julie we've seen never existed, all of a sudden everything in the story takes a deeper meaning and we can appreciate all the time it took to create a detailed character study of Sarah Morton.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how literate this movie was, the symbolism very well constructed. It's funny how people either critisize or praise all the nudity and sexuality common in European film, however here nudity and sexuality were intrinsically necessary because they were such a crucial component underlying the mechanics of Sarah Morton's personality. She was so repressed! I really liked how Julie's appetite for sex, rich food, and swimming in the ""dirty"" pool was a mirror for just how badly Sarah lacked all of these things. I especially loved the scenes where Sarah eats yogurt and wheat germ. Here we have a woman, who although she is super wealthy and can afford any type of food, instead chooses to deprieve herself of such a basic source of pleasure as eating appetizing food.<br /><br />It is a nice contradiction that Sarah is very wealthy on the outside yet starving (for good food, sexuality, a zest for living, creativity) on the inside. This movie further gives evidence to the fact that fame and wealth are not a guarantee of genuine happiness in life.<br /><br />The ending to this film made it all worthwhile, however and it is very exciting when we feel we need a 2nd viewing of a movie to really absorb it all. I will watch it again and who knows? I might not find the first 70 minutes too slow after all.<br /><br />",Performance,Visual Effect,
"After viewing this movie, I'd have to say that it was probably the worst decision of my recent past to spend money on it. This movie is just god-awful. Brittany Murphy portrays a girlfriend who is crafty and intuitive but at the same time clueless. Suspecting hidden motives and doubting everything, which gives us the answer to the rhetorical question posed in the beginning (the answer to which, by the way, is exactly what you would expect). This movie it seems cannot decide whether it wants to be another pointless fun movie or try and get something serious and philosophical across. It fails miserably at both. The acting is dull, and there is no interest in trying to understand the characters (the poor writing makes the viewer give the extra effort to figure them out for themselves which frankly is not worth it). Recycled cheap laughs (singing in the bathroom) are just stupid and the whole movie seems like a commercial for a certain musician who in my opinion is just as good at creating moving songs as this movie is at getting good reviews. Basically I warn you very strongly not to see this: the characters go on a journey but seem intent on leaving you in the dust as they do, lackluster performances and lame jokes accentuate the diverse plot in a way that takes whatever potential this movie had to be decent and throws it down the drain.",Performance,,

"I saw this film on the International FilmFestival Rotterdam. Perhaps it was due to all the great films I already saw, but i did not like this film one bit. It was full of clichés and I didn't see anything original. This story has been told a thousand times and can - in Holland - be seen every week in the ""true stories"" movie-series. Furthermore I thought that the acting by Maggie Cheung was - to say the least - not very convincing. Especially as a sensitive rock 'n roll junkie. Assayas has tried to show how well he can combine the feeling of a rock 'n roll movie with a humane drama in three languages and an international setting. I wish he had focused more on the plot and less on the so-called cosmopolitan setting and hadn't cast his ex-wife in this film.

"I've only watched two Charlie Chaplin films as of this date, this one and the outstanding CITY LIGHTS. However, they alone are already enough to convince me that Chaplin was a genius, and a very funny man. Here he plays his famous tramp character, who is first involved in a hilarious chase sequence with the cops throughout the circus. When his physical antics prove funnier to the paying crowd than the clowns already acting in the show, the mean and abusive ringmaster hires Chaplin as a funnyman for the circus. There are consistent funnies all along the way, but also an endearing story of his affection for a female horse rider from the show, who's sweet on someone else.<br /><br />I often say that silent films are not my favorite type, and I don't care for the silent Laurel and Hardy films like I do their early talkies, because I love hearing their verbal exchanges (especially Hardy's). But when it comes to Charlie Chaplin I can't imagine his work being as entertaining any other way than silent, with him relying on pantomime over voice.

"I detest the modern horror film, especially those with gratuitous violence. I watched this one because the violence was reported to be NOT gratuitous. It wasn't, but it fell short of being good.<br /><br />It's obvious that the two boys are frustrated in dealing with girls. They understand that to play the game, you have to be ""nice"" to girls and ""obey"" them, and if you're poor, ugly and awkward you have to debase yourself even more. Thus the discovery of a ""living dead girl"" is a dream come true; a girl they can have sex with, without pretending to be ""nice."" It's been suggested that the film is actually a fantasy, or a metaphor playing out in the boys' heads. Maybe so, but the filmmakers didn't wish to make that clear. In fact, we don't really get to understand the boys enough to figure out why they might turn sadistic and violent. Is this what is inside every rejected, lonely nerd? Are we all Harris and Klebold just waiting for an occasion to strike? We don't know, and the film doesn't want to tell us.<br /><br />Incomplete, fragmented and unclear storytelling do not make a film ""deep.""

George Bancroft, Betty Compson, and Olga Baclanova are all great is this cynical yet tender story of the waterfront.<br /><br />Director Josef von Sternberg fills a simple tale with pathos and great atmosphere.

But he gets involved in a web of murder, thievery, and drunkenness.<br /><br />When Norma Desmond said ""we had faces then"" in Sunset Boulevard (and yes I know it was Gloria Swanson), Betty Compson was at the top of the list. With her big eyes and crooked mouth, Compson was expert at expressing emotion with a twist of the mouth, a flick of the eyelashes. She is wonderful here as Mae, the waterfront gal. Bancroft is also terrific as the big lug who falls hard for Mae.

"This film was quite a pleasant surprise. I would recommend it to every one as it certainly is good cinema. A class above the stereotypical Bollywood genre you would normally expect out of South Asia, this Pakistani film explores the origins of religious fundamentalism in Pakistan along with the horrors following Partition that still scar the memories of many in the region. I would probably rate this above 1947 Earth and certainly consider it to be the most influential movies I have seen on Partition. Excellent camera work, fluent and appropriate use of Punjabi script and great top notch acting by Kiron Kher along with many veteran Pakistani actors will leave you full of emotion after you see the film. The subtitles could be a bit better for the Non-Punjabi viewer, and i think a little more spotlight should have been put on how and why the religious fundamentalist gathered such momentum in a nation leaning more towards Moderate rule after Bhutto's regime. The fact that these groups had strong economic and social backing from the U.S at the time, as they were the ones fighting the war against communist Russia should have been brought out more plainly for the viewer not familiar with the politics and history of the region at the time. And it is these same groups that received such full fledged support from the U.S at the time and painted as 'Holy Warriors' by the Western Media that are now considered terrorist organizations in the post 9/11 era. This point that the U.S played a vital hand in strengthening Islamic fundamentalist organizations under Zia's rule was i think not driven home to the extent it could have been.

"This is one of those light movies that is so charming and enjoyable you can't even begrudge its slightly sappy ending. Hiroshi Tamaki stars as Segawa Makoto, a university student who shies away from people because of an unknown illness. He's interested in photography and one day while taking pictures in the woods he runs into Satonaka Shizuru, a quirky waif and classmate, adorably played by Aoi Miyazaki. The normally shy Makoto feels strangely relaxed with the energetic Shizuru, and the two form a friendship. Complications arise from Shizuru being not-so-secretly in love with the oblivious Segawa, who's instead in love with another classmate, the beautiful Miyuki, as well as Shizuru's illness.<br /><br />Both leads are good, though frankly this is a movie which they don't really have to do much besides act cute. Still I have to praise Aoi Miyazaki, who stole the movie. I'll be honest, I'm one of those grinches who usually can't stand the relentlessly cute and cheerful, squeaky-voiced female protagonists popular in Asian romances. But Aoi Miyazaki completely charmed me with her exuberant performance, which seemed natural despite its childishness. It took me a little while to get used to Hiroshi's Tamaki's performance, I felt he overplayed the awkwardness of his character in the beginning. But he and Miyazaki have a really nice and easygoing chemistry, and they form a realistic couple you want to root for. Supporting characters aren't annoying (if you've watched Asian dramas, you'll know what I mean).<br /><br />Thinking back, I'm struck by how perfectly balanced the cuteness and unforced emotion was in the movie. Too many romantic dramedies tend to overdo the former, in my opinion, and sacrifice the latter to get a tear, by setting up melodrama. Not to say that this movie doesn't do that. The ending is the cliché melodramatic ending we've see again and again in Asian romances. Yet it works because the movie has engendered so much good will along the way and it shows just enough restraint.<br /><br />The cinematography is adequate. I feel it didn't quite utilize the full beauty of the title forest(there was perhaps a little too much light in the scenes). That perhaps speaks for the movie as a whole. It's a little too fluffy to be substantial, there have been more original and sensitive versions of its basic plot line.

"This film was absolutely horrible. I rarely write any reviews, but this was the absolutely worse film I have seen in years. It made Mission to Mars look like an epic. The film is just nonsense action followed by nonsense action. None of the characters are ever developed, they try but the actors obviously don't know what they were supposed to be doing, so the audience never figures it out. Certain plot elements like the zombies completely surrounding them just disappear after a while and noone seems to notice. They have the typical problem that bad horror films have of inconsistency. Sometimes, one thing will kill a monster and in a different scene, someone does the same thing to the monster 25 times and it hardly flinches. I guess it was supposed to be a prequel for the video games, but even with that it seemed unfinished at all levels. I was a little tired before going to this film and got myself awake early in the film and watched it.

"I really wanted to like this film for a couple of reasons 1. Annie Griifin did a fine job with the Book Club and 2. It's British. Sadly neither reason proved strong enough for me to be able to overlook Festival's many flaws. <br /><br />I can only guess that Griffin's original aim was to write a movie where comedy and tragedy were so closely linked that it was difficult to see where one ended and the other began and what better backdrop that the Edinburgh Festival which every year attracts acts from all four corners of the world, who come to entertain and supposedly change their lives? Definitely a strong starting point for a funny, touching and thought provoking movie, unfortunately this ain't it. <br /><br />For one thing we are asked to focus on far too many characters, assorted comics, bizarre actors and various hangers on who each have a story to tell but no time in which to tell it. As a result they never become anything other than one dimensional characters and unpleasant ones at that. Who is Faith, the actress behind the one woman show about Dorothy Wordsworth? Why has she chosen to do this? Why has she brought it to Edinburgh, what is she hoping to achieve? We never find out. Is Brother Mark a real priest. Why does Petra put up with Sean? Is she in love with his or just too apathetic to do anything else with her life? What's with the Canadian trio whose show touches the audience but who are presented to us as buffoons. And what about the depressed mother who abandons her child in what is presented to us as some sort of happy and romantic love story. Ditto the Perrier Awards which seem to be tacked on as an afterthought or just an excuse to introduce a bunch of stereotypical arty journalists spewing line upon line of bitchy clichés. Lots of questions but no answers and as a result the film added up to little more than an unholy mess. <br /><br />And then the sex scenes. One commentator actually applauded these graphic and let's be honest gratuitous scenes decalring them to be ""real"" Well maybe he has been fisted many times on the floor of a puppet shop by a bald punk, I would hazard a guess and say that many of us have not. Guess that means movies like 'Deepthroat' should be regarded as social documentaries rather than porno junk. <br /><br />I could go on to talk about the nonsensical punch up at the end but what would be the point?

Indulging in drinking, even when he's working, Mosley is a man cruising along the rock bottom of his life and work. One day at work, Mosely gets another routine and uneventful assignment - bring a witness, some petty crook named Eddie, to court by 10am. He's got 118 minutes to do it and only has to go 16 blocks. Simple? Sure, Mosley even stops to pick up a bottle of booze along the way there. But then... the unexpected starts to happen and Mosely must snap out of his delirium because this witness is wanted dead. And not just by anyone, by fellow cops.<br /><br />Film goers might be initially unimpressed with this film where Bruce Willis plays a ""lone cop at the bottom of the barrel."" He's done the cop role many many times - Die hard 'nuff said - and the cop with problems is also a re-run from Willis - Strking Distance & Last Boy Scout. But don't let that get you down, this film is no way in the shadow of the mentioned films. Director Richard Donner directs the film with strong characterization while keeping the action exciting, but critically incidental to what the characters go through. A good example of this is the scene where Mosley realizes that he could very well be in deep sh*t as he just shot a guy who tried to kill his witness - a circling shot with dissolves whirls around Mosely who stands with jaw agape. No sound, the character is still, and really nothing obvious goes on in the frame, yet you still get the feeling that Mosely has: ""holysh*t, I just shot that guy."" You can tell that he pulled out his gun and fired like he was trained, but that critical realization afterward propels the film as much into the mind of Mosley and Eddie (who is also shocked here) as it propels into the street of lower Manhattan.<br /><br />Donner also chooses his settings carefully with key scenes taking place in basements and at Mosely apartment - not just in some random alleyway. The films takes leaps and dives throughout all of its settings like Mosely and Eddie do within themselves and this subtle touch is very effective. It shows how wild of ride it is for them, how low they have been driven by what they did or what has happened to them, and how close to home it may hit in the end. That makes this one of Bruce Willis's best performances. While not as high-octane as his many previous efforts, this film is clearly not meant to be, and that doesn't at all detract from the film's entertainment.<br /><br />And it is not just Willis giving a fine performance. David Morse gives a typically strong supporting role, but mention must be made of Mos Def. There have been plenty of action films with rappers and hip-hop stars, even two in late 2005, and a film goer can only be skeptical with Mos Def playing opposite Willis. But, in a pleasant surprise, Mos Def actually plays his part not just for the cool. In fact, he is kind of an annoying brat that you'd like to smack over the head. Especially if you're a cop trying to get him to court and bullets are flying at you. This refreshing approach breathes a sort of life into the movie and the film moves even farther from ""goofy action movie"" category. And don't get me wrong, I love goofy action movies - The Last Boy Scout is one of my all time favorites and so are Donner's Lethal Weapon films - but enough is enough and it is a real breath of fresh air to see a great action director, an action star, and a rapper (or hip hop guy, I am not good at distinguishing that sort of thing) deliver a film that is good both dramatically and action-wise. 8/10<br /><br />Rated PG-13: violence",Performance,Plot,
"I have to admit that the first time I saw this film (the color version) I wasn't too enthused with it, probably because it was 3am on a Sunday morning. But after I saw it a second time (the full Black and White version), I fell in love with it and I now own it on DVD and have seen it quite a few more times.<br /><br />I found this movie to be very interesting and also very saddening. Though it is characterized as a piece of fictitious work, ""?"" is brutal honesty in its rawest form. While many will knock this film because of its pornographic nature or constant attacks on society, I was able to see the deep, hard points the story brings out about the world we live in today. Those who criticize swearing in movies and the other things meant to be rude and crude, will not like ""?"", but these elements were downright funny to me and fans of the dark comedy genre should definitely own this film!<br /><br />I do really like this film, and it made me laugh over and over again.",Others,,
"Julie Gavras is famous politically committed director Costa-Gavras'daughter and it shows. But be reassured ""La faute à Fidel"", her first fiction film (coming after a pair of interesting documentaries) isn't a carbon copy of a Costa Gavras movie in any way. It is much more exciting than just that in that it examines thoroughly the pros and the cons of leftist involvement, mainly its negative repercussions on family life.<br /><br />The plot revolves around little nine-year-old Anna( played to perfection by tense, brooding, occasionally warming to a welcome smile Nina Kervel), whose life is turned upside down when her parents abruptly change from well-to-do upper middle class people to leftist activists, with a feminist inclination concerning the mother. The whole film will describe the difficulties of a little girl who loses all of her privileges out of the blue, how she understandably rebels against such injustice (even rich kids have a cause to defend!) and who very slowly gets to understand her parents' choices, eventually coming to terms with the situation and growing mature (more mature than the standard brat) in the process.<br /><br />The movie really charmed me from the beginning to the end, ringing true all the time (the early seventies are well captured, whether when it comes to the production values or the depiction of the mentalities of the time). And Julie Gavras knows her subject on the tip of her fingers. Her parents  just like Anna's ones  have always been leftist activists and wasn't her dwelling-place invaded by Chilean ""barbudos"" while her dad was preparing ""Missing""?<br /><br />The viewers share her empathy for the central character and appreciate her refusal to resort to caricature. Of course Anna's grandparents are ""grand bourgeois"" but they are not horrible persons. On the other hand, a leftist activist is not perfect by definition. Those ambiguities give depth to the characters and make them believable throughout. And Julie Gavras has a knack for unexpected details enhancing the viewer's interest and involvement in the story. I was particularly amused by such features as Anna adoring her catechism class, the presence of a violently anticommunist Cuban domestic worker (hence the title), the succession of nannies exiled from different countries torn by ideological conflicts, Anna singing ""Ay, Carmela!"" to protest against her parents quarreling and many others.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful initiation movie that augurs well for Julie Gavras' future career.",Directional Techniques,Performance,Plot
"I watched this on TV last night, and I just want to say first and foremost that I am a die-hard Rankin Bass fan. That being said: It wasn't bad in terms of TV special quality (which isn't saying much). The first will always be better; great original Christmas specials can never be made better. But it made three choices that make it OK in my book: 1) It was not remade as a CG feature (who else was creeped out by the bad CG animation remakes these last few years?).<br /><br />2) It kept at least one of the Rankin Bass songs. I had so prepared myself for the lack of music, which defines the magic of the original... but we do get to hear a live action remake of the Heat Miser / Cold Miser song that I thoroughly enjoyed (with choreographed sexy dancing ladies, for some reason). It's rare to see characters singing anymore in TV or the Movies; even the latest Disney films lack that, so I was surprised and delighted to hear this version.<br /><br />3) It claims to be based on the original book of the same name that Rankin and Bass based their story on, therefore giving more room for interpretation without necessarily being a remake of the original movie.<br /><br />Of course, there are noticeable flaws. Overuse of throwbacks to previous Christmas specials and pop culture references, for one. The acting was very stilted, and it was obvious that many of these NBC TV stars were fulfilling an obligation of some sort to the network. The editing, writing, and costuming was often downright confusing (can anyone help explain Carol Kane's getup?).<br /><br />But did I enjoy myself? Yup. Do I expect to see this on TV again next year? Definitely not. So try to catch it if you can; if not, just pop in the original and have a very merry holiday.",Directional Techniques,,

Look no further than this movie, for a prime example of such.

"Much of this cinematic waste of time feels like a rip-off of ""The Integral Trees"", Larry Niven's 1984 masterpiece. Given the possible variety of plant and animal life-forms that could evolve, thrive and be animated in conditions of continual free-fall, all this film does is drop like a stone. Problem is, I really wanted to like this because of the environmental/physical similarities, but the dialog was inane and I suspect the original target audience was actually older than the 7 - 10 year old demographic to which it belongs (due to some fairly graphic violence, e.g., blood spatter). Also, the tone is so preachy I only kept watching so I might see if it could be saved by the insertion of a cute air-bunny or something to provide comic relief (no luck there, just whining pirates). If you can endure the saccharin and the stolen physical metaphors (e.g., worst use of a flying whale as a template for terror), have fun ripping it to shreds (ala MST3000).",Directional Techniques,,

Pretty much everything in this picture is 12th-rate, except for two things: the photography (which looks very good) and Rosalind Allen (who looks even better). Allen is just so stunningly beautiful, and is a good enough actress, that you wonder why she keeps getting herself trapped in low-budget junk like this when she can do, and has done, much better. She has the class, attitude and bearing of a Grace Kelly, which makes this cheap movie look even cheaper. If you're a Rosalind Allen fan, check it out. If you're not, then there is no reason on earth why you should come anywhere near this movie.",Performance,,
"Overall, a rather bad movie with a few redeeming qualities. Vampires in Las Vegas run amok and are hunted by a variety of police officers, who eventually defeat the vampires with the help of a sexy nun. Naturally. There are a number of flaws in the movies: day turns to night and night to day in the middle of scenes; characters' appearances change between cut away scenes, only two vampires combusted when exposed to daylight while many others walked around during the day without problems. The number of gaffes in the film provide the viewer ample opportunity to play ""find the error."" The main premise of the movie seems adequate (hunting down a 300 year old vampire who has returned to seek a new wife), but there are too many sub-plots floating around that provide tenuous links to the main premise.<br /><br />Three characters stand out for their contributions to this film. Eric Etenari does an excellent job as the main vampire's henchman, a smooth talking, lady's man who provides the boss with his victims. Comic relief is provided by two legendary stars of the 1970s, Fred Williamson (who also directed the movie) and Richard Roundtree (best known for his role as Shaft). In some sense, Vegas Vampires seemed to be an effort, though largely deficient, to remember the days of the blaxploitation films in which Roundtree and Williamson starred in the 1970s.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
"""Breaking and Entering"" is about breaking the shells that separate people and entering their lives. While there, they cause pain and joy to each other, they get engaged - and this is what is required for people to be together. Parallel between social projects and individual lives is director's solution, by example, how these social projects may become real  they must be validated through individual lives of participants. <br /><br />Jude Law needed this role to show his actor's skill  not just good looks  in my estimation he did well. Juliette Binoche, besides being as always adorable, plays role of Serbian Moslem émigré very believably. The rest of characters are supporting and did a good job. Director's work was solid  not brilliant but very professional and credible. <br /><br />Positive: Good cast, deliberate attempt to build a situation that would address a social condition using individual-social metaphor, solid craftsmanship in directorial work. <br /><br />Negative: The ideas are not well develop and too simplistic. The ""Breaking and Entering"" as a step in overcoming individual alienation is unconvincing. <br /><br />Conclusion: If you wish a food for thought, albeit imperfect, see this film  for me it will always beat ""The Dark Knight"" (9.2/10) or ""Star Wars"" (9/10). The rating of 8 was given on the background of everyday's trash produced by Hollywood encouraged by mindless crowds filling movie theaters and elevating ratings for such trash to the astronomical levels - for them Socrates' ""An unexamined life is not worth living"" has no meaning.",Performance,Plot,

Usually I hate it when someone talks during a movie. However, in this one, someone said ""Did they forget their lines?"" and everyone in the theater laughed.

"The experience of watching Boytown left me as underwhelmed as I have possibly ever been in my movie-going lifetime. It's understandable if a film is simply poor, but when the talent on disposal here comes up with something as utterly dull as what we see on Boytown, the frustration soon turns to sheer hostility.<br /><br />With a tremendous legacy to Australian comedy with his appearances on the The Late Show and on radio Mick Molloy appeared headed towards a promising movie career with the release of his first film Crackerjack, an enjoyable F.O.W romp with an outstanding ensemble cast and a handful of legitimate laugh-out-loud moments. If Boytown is anything to go by Molloy is already out of ideas as a writer and his performance on the screen (much like the rest of the cast) lacks energy and the chemistry that we should expect from a cast that includes Glenn Robbins, Bob Franklin and Wayne Hope, all of them veterans of the Australian comedy scene with many years of experience working together.<br /><br />If there's anything to be taken from the film it's that a handful of the songs may bring a smile to your face, but Spinal Tap these guys ain't. If anything Molloy should have brought more of the silliness of the song lyrics to the script. Instead Boytown relies solely on it's silly premise while the performers actually appearing on screen are uninteresting and lifeless and ultimately unfunny. Wayne Hope is totally wasted as the butt of lame homosexual jokes while Glenn Robbins, one of the most talented comedic clowns in Australian television history is inexplicably one of the most boring straight men to play the lead in an Australian comedy in recent memory.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment though is Molloy. That a guy of genuine talent can be content releasing uninspiring filth such as Boytown suggests he is careless, or worse, ran out of ideas on Crackerjack. At least it doesn't look like he's having too much fun on screen - I can't imagine how anyone watching could have any fun off it.",Performance,Directional Techniques,

"Brigitte (Emily Perkins) destroyed the werewolf that was her sister at the end of the first movie. Now she's infected with the same virus that's slowly turning her, and she senses that another werewolf is on the prowl for her. After an encounter with the thing, she collapses in a snow bank to find herself awakening in and confined to a rehab clinic. And the werewolf is naturally still after her, while she continuously injects herself with monkshood to stave off her inevitable transformation.<br /><br />This intense and gruesome sequel is a worthy follow-up to the superb Canadian werewolf picture ""Ginger Snaps"". While it may not be completely satisfactory for viewers craving a high body count, it still piles on a fair bit of gore for prime visceral impact. It's got some decent chase scenes and constantly creates a feeling of utter gloom. It's not that there isn't humor, but it's largely of the dark variety, and the film-makers and cast play out their material with total conviction.<br /><br />What certainly helps is that the film looks as if it was filmed during an actual Canadian winter. Knowing full well just how cold and forbidding they can get, I believe it adds to the unrelenting atmosphere of the piece. The cinematography seems to deliberately shy away from most bright colors, and the tension is increased by the low-key but effective music score.<br /><br />There are some standout sequences. Life is clearly not easy for Brigitte; she finds that living life on her terms will come to be difficult and that she will have to make deals to get what she needs. Her late sister Ginger (the lovely Katharine Isabelle makes a welcome return appearance) appears in visions. The intelligent script draws the comparison between the curse of the werewolf and other ills of the young female demographic, and allows the film to refrain from being predictable. It gives Brigitte an offbeat young companion named ""Ghost"" (Tatiana Maslany) with whom she can share dialog and compare her own bleak world view; ""Ghost"" is a comic book addict and sees the werewolf persona as an appropriate antihero for a world beset by problems.<br /><br />One will also notice that with the possible exception of minor characters, not a single male individual on hand is sympathetic, thereby accenting the need for females to rely on each other.<br /><br />Co-starring are Janet Kidder (Margots' niece), Brendan Fletcher, and Eric Johnson, with each putting in a solid effort.<br /><br />The ending is an intriguing surprise and worth waiting for, and the film is overall a good entry in its series and a respectable addition to the canon of werewolf films.<br /><br />8/10",Performance,Plot,

This movie is absolutely atrocious in every aspect: directing, acting, special effects, dialog, plot-line, you name it.

"Introduced to this show through a sibling who devoured R. L. Stine's books, I found I initially couldn't form my opinion of it since the first handful of episodes I saw happened to be based on the books I hadn't read (why is it the books you most want to read are the hardest to find?), but once I was lucky (unlucky?) enough to see ones based on the stories I'd read, my opinion was: the ones whose story counterparts I hadn't seen were decent on their own, but those based off of books I had were mediocre in comparison. All of them do seem pretty formula now in retrospect: an evil threatens but only the young protagonist realizes and has a difficult time making anyone else aware. The books are almost always formula in this point too - but Stine was phenomenal in spicing the stories up by conjuring up different humorous dialogue, explanations for the evil, or details to make it seem impressive to a kid. I found the books to be interesting but the show was never enough to scare even a 6-year-old, and I wondered why Stine was actually the host on this show rather than rejecting writers Billy Brown & Dan Angel and hunting for someone more faithful. The fact that (with a few exceptions that ran 2 episodes), each story was limited to less than 30 minutes (the commercial breaks which accounted for the ""less than"" were surrounded by fade-outs of some new terror arising - which, even the youngest viewer realized after a few breaks, would be a false alarm when it resumed) rushed the plots of stories I laughed and fascinated over in book form, giving no time to absorb the scares, other than the phony ones resolved in 60 seconds while the camera dimmed and returned. I appreciated significantly more those that ran 2 episodes for just under an hour, even with the fade-outs still causing boredom. The plots of these left on a cliffhanger after one episode and there was usually a better twist at the end. Also, since fewer action scenes were shown in most of the single-episode simpler stories, special effects were severely limited; I never found the antagonists as terrifying as they could be in imagination. Example: the book ""Let's Get Invisible"" doesn't instantly reveal who the being behind the mirror is, but the show has a dead giveaway as he wears a jersey with BACKWARD LETTERING - just plain cheesy! In the 3rd series, a large number of episodes were wasted not on books, but on short stories in his compilations Stories to Give You Goosebumps, which contained 10 boring stories (the one I tried and failed to read was the one never used to base TV scenes off of, but I'm sure the others were no better) which often provoked no fear even on the page - imagine how a screen adaption even weaker than their book basis would've been! No, the plot wasn't rushed; even worse - it was as though the while plot was shown but it was a rushed story to begin with! Ironically my favorite episode (along with a 3-part story I shouldn't mention; it wasn't based on a book) of which I've seen was one of these, ""Click"" - I doubt it was meant to be scary, but it did make me laugh expecting that the boy who exploited a space- and time-controlling remote could so easily be punished!

"This was better than I had expected. Maybe not quite up there with Public Enemy and the original Scarface, but not that far behind.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good for an early talkie. Cagney is great as usual as the head gangster's top henchman. Lew Ayres acts well as the head guy, ""the Napoleon of crime"", although he's perhaps a little too cleancut looking for the role.<br /><br />The story is good, and rather dark. Mobster Louie Ricarno, after uniting all the gangs in Chicago under one organization, tries to quit crime. But things fall apart in his absence, and he's forced to return for purposes of revenge. The ending is nicely grim and while there might be enough of a ""crime doesn't pay"" moral to keep the censors happy it doesn't rub it in your face. There's some good gangster violence along the way.- a number of well-done hits, and an over- the-top scene that resembles a full-scale battle.<br /><br />Two other things struck me as memorable: The adulterous relationship between Cagney and his boss' wife. At one point, she takes off her wedding ring, and then they ""go somewhere"".<br /><br />The police captain, O'Grady, is a rather ruthless character. He blackmails Cagney into a false confession for a crime he didn't commit, by threatening to tell Ayres about his affair with Ayres's wife! Later, he lets Ayres's rivals bump him off, rather than prosecute him and risk an acquittal.

In one shot a Marine takes cover carrying a bolt-action rifle. One of the team openly smokes crack. They all look like bums.<br /><br />It's not so much the wardrobe or props that turn this potentially interesting, if already familiar, story into the wreck that it is. It's the clumsy writing and the indifferent direction. The gold is there but no one has separated it from the dross. I mean -- an island that has been deserted for fifty years. Scattered live ammunition. The left over camp in which human beings were forced to live during World War II. What a fascinating place to explore, all by itself. But no atmosphere is captured, no real mystery or suspense generated. They go ashore on this deserted island and everything begins to happen, one thing after another, really FAST, as if to prevent the audience from being bored because a scene lasts longer and is more revealing than a Head On commercial (""apply directly to the forehead!""). When I was a kid I explored an empty army base, Fort Hancock, NJ, and stumbled across a pile of live 20 millimeter shells abandoned in a swamp. Not knowing better, I tried juggling a few of the unstable things. Now -- in retrospect -- THAT was exciting. This isn't.

"I just finished watching this movie and I think it is one of the best I have seen in a long time. It manages to combine a ghost story, a love story or two, a teenage rivalry, a suspense-thriller, a get-even story, and a ""I'm-not-telling"" (grin) ending.<br /><br />Children and adults can both enjoy this film. It manages to avoid any gorey scenes and yet includes plenty of rising suspense and timely comic relief.<br /><br />The two youthful stars, Ricky and Elisha, are truly great actors and will no doubt have very long, very successful careers. I look forward to seeing them play in more movies soon because they certainly can act. The pair put quite a lot of ""punch"" into the story, making all aspects of it real and involving.<br /><br />I really recommend you see this film.

"Things begin going downhill at break-neck speed about the time our hero is forced to wrestle what is obviously a giant rubber spider. While the idea that the dark side of the moon resembles Hugh Heffner's penthouse is appealing, this is one of those movies, made in the early 50s, that made an evening at home in front of the TV seem like a better choice. The FX, such as they are, are transparent, almost as much as the acting. I suppose this could be a 'good watch' if one wanted to see what we had out there during that time frame. This picture was released both in 3D and 'flat' simultaeneously, so Dad took us to see it twice, so we could 'compare.' I think he really just had a thing for the lovely Ms. Windsor.",Others,,
"A lot has already been said about this compelling, oft-overlooked film, virtually all of which hits the proverbial nail on the head. While Eric Braeden delivers a superb, understated performance as Dr. Charles Forbin, the fact is that the real star of the film is the vast, omnipotent machine he has created. Even before it begins to speak with the chilling Cylonesque voice it has ordered designed for itself (the great Paul Frees like you've never heard him before), you'll find yourself glued to the screen watching Colossus ""talk"" to its supposed masters over its huge monitors.<br /><br />A word about Frees' contribution to the film: In ""War Games,"" for example, the computer has a curious sort of empathetic communication style (""Wouldn't you rather play a nice game of chess?"") presented in a voice that sounds like E.T. filtered through a synthesizer. Frees gives Colossus an emotionless yet fearful quality of speech that seems to belie its implacable drive to dominate human destiny.<br /><br />My favorite part of this film has always been, and will always be, the climactic monologue Colossus announces to the listening masses of humanity. From its opening line -- ""This is the voice of world control,"" an identity neither Colossus nor its counterpart, Guardian, had used to that point -- you know this isn't going to be a happy speech if you are a sentient, flesh & blood resident of the Earth. What is particularly creepy about the speech is that, for all of its strangely optimistic sermonizing about how ""the human millennium will be fact"" and how the computer will set about the task of ""solving all the mysteries of the universe for the betterment of man"" -- outwardly the Utopian dream -- the message Colossus is presenting is set against the dreadful backdrop of ""disobey (me) and die."" As Colossus intones, ""You say you lose your freedom. Freedom is an illusion. All you lose is the emotion of pride."" In the end, unlike other supercomputer-run-amok films such as ""War Games"" or ""Tron,"" ""Colossus"" is an end-of-the-world story without the nuclear or viral holocaust. In this film, it is the human spirit that is the casualty while the human biology lingers on. Unlike the rest of the doomsday genre, our end comes not so much with a bang as it does with a whimper.",Performance,Plot,
"First I must admit that I could not sit through the entire film. After only 30 minutes, I realized that none of the characters from the book were in the film, just card board cut-outs. They took a nervous and fearful Adam and made him a smiling and waving awkward kid. Heck, Amy wasn't even a tomboy. They butchered the atmosphere as well, no suspense or sense of foreboding. So I shipped to the end and guess what, they butchered the ending too.<br /><br />Read the book, it has awesome characters and a story that builds and keeps you thinking and an ending worth talking about. As for the movie, shame on everyone involved in its making and shame on you if you watch it after reading this.",Plot,,
"Well, it may not be everyone's cup of tea and it certainly has it's flaws - but for me at least, Fortress is one of the most fun B-movies released in the nineties, and that's no surprise considering it's helmed by the great Stuart Gordon! One of the main reasons why Fortress works so well is because it puts its focus in one place and every imaginative element of the film goes towards furthering the central plot. The title refers to the impregnable privately owned prison of the title. We are introduced to this penitentiary and its various pitfalls right from the start and while it's not hard to see where the film is going to go, it does at least make you wonder how it's going to get there. The central characters are John and Karen Brennick - a couple sent to the Fortress after she becomes pregnant with a second child, thus breaking a futuristic population control law. However, John isn't happy to just rot away in jail, and despite the numerous pitfalls that makes the Fortress escape proof - along with his fellow prisoners, he plots to escape with his wife.<br /><br />The basis of Fortress is your classic prison escape movie, the only difference being the prison at the centre of the tale. The Fortress itself is certainly made good use of as the inventive methods in place to stop the prisoners escaping are constantly kept at the forefront of the audience's mind. The film really is never boring for a minute; if there isn't something directly going on in the movie then Gordon is using the time to build up the situation that the prisoners find themselves in. The film features a good B-movie cast, with 'Highlander' Christopher Lambert taking the lead role. Lambert is hardly a great actor, but he at least looks the part and his athleticism serves him well. Loryn Locklin isn't given much to do as the leading lady, but the rest of the support cast includes the likes of Lincoln Kilpatrick, Vernon Wells (who, coincidently, was also in the 1986 Australian movie of the same title!) and Jeffrey Combs, who is just great as always. Kurtwood Smith is probably the biggest standout, however, as the maniacal head of the Fortress. This film really features everything you could ever want from a B-movie - constant action, imagination and some hilarious performances. It all boils down to a suitably over the top climax and while this might not be the best film ever made - its one hell of a lot of fun and I certainly recommend it!",Directional Techniques,Plot,
"I was lucky enough to catch this one during a visit to Manhattan earlier this year. I sort of forgot about it but seeing it listed on the IMDb jogged my memory. This is in the spirit of those 1970s films with a wronged woman out for bloody revenge. In general you can tell that this is a low budget production all around but there is a genuine spark with the director/star and most of the acting. Since I don't have it on tape or DVD to check the character's names, I'm sure if I remember who was who. But the lead villain was kind of weak, there could have been a better casting choice there. He came across too soft to be real and like he was reading the script as he was going along and overall not very believable. It would of improved the overall quality if they had someone better in that role. The lead actress, Tiffany Sinclare is strong and gives a very interesting performance. When she is on the screen you are drawn like a magnet to watch. The Turkish guy who plays one of the bad guy's henchmen is also very good and you can tell he should have a good career ahead of him. The scenes with the police are also not too strong and could have been better done. There is a lot of violence, violence towards women especially, so steer clear if that bothers you. But there's a good tight story with a touch of the ghostly supernatural. This would make for a good Halloween night film showing.",Performance,,
"Dracula: Legacy is the third and final installment to Dracula series. I saw the first one and liked the whole storyline but it was poorly executed. I saw the second one..........I adored Stephen Billinton as Dracula. One of the finest Dracula acting jobs I've seen yet. But the second Dracula made no sense with the first one....so I didn't really like that one. Then for old times sake I thought to myself ""why not!"" So I rented the last one. I just recently spent 2 weeks in Romania and found the interpretation of Romania to be offensive. This country had it's revolution in 89 and is becoming much more powerful....it's finding it's place and regaining it's footing. In some area's it's very poor but it's not creepy. But, the Hollywood Romania will always be there so ""c'est la vie!"" There are some pros and cons to this movie. A pro is it's shot in the mother country that created spookiness. I have to say some Gypsy Clans are really creepy there. I really enjoyed Jason London as Luke. He is a very comedic actor but can relay very deep levels of emotion. I loved it in the end when he kills Elizabeth. Oh yes...Jason Scott Lee....oh Jason Scott Lee....why must you ruin every scene you're in. Lee seems liked a very nice man but he makes Orlando Bloom looked like an Academy Award Winner. The character it's self it pretty cool....don't get me wrong....he has some good points but overall weak performance. The character of Julie really bugged me at first. But Westcourt really proved herself in her death scene. Diane Neal was terrible in Dracula 2....but she really proves herself in Dracula 3 to be a good actress. She looked very sensual. Hauer was OK, he wasn't good and he wasn't bad. He seemed to babble a lot through this movie, from what I heard he improvised a lot of his lines..which would explain that. Also, I think my favorite character was that random guy that collected girls for Dracula to feed on. He was unintentionally really funny. He reminded me a lot of that child kidnapper from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I was really drawn to him for some strange reason. Now, I think one of my favorite scenes in this whole movie is strangely the vampire pit. It was so vulgar and primal that you just had to love it. I also liked that the writers touched immortality and it's toll. That Dracula once handsome and alluring, now takes a worn out and gaunt look. They could have shown and explained it much better though. And what was up with those stupid TVs??? It was so confusing.<br /><br />Another scene I really liked was the circus vampires attacked Lee in the street. It was really creepy and cool. Then......I loved the ending. It really proved it's self in the end. Good and evil....black and white....and the grey lines in between were touched beautifully in the end. When I look back on this movie I think it was a pretty good straight to DVD kinda movie.",Performance,Plot,
"""The Violation of the Bitch"", is a very interesting title and one that made me confident that I was about to see something at least passable...but unfortunately, the film doesn't live up to it's title and unfortunately it's more of a missed opportunity than a great exploitation flick. The plot makes it sound like the film is going to be interesting too, and we focus on a young girl who has a recurring nightmare of a man on horseback raping her. She goes to live with a sex starved female and they soon kick up a relationship; but then the nightmare rapist manifests himself and a strange love triangle develops. I have to admit that the version I saw was only seventy three minutes long and may well have been a cut version; but unless they cut out all the interesting bits, this is still a bad film. The characters should really be important in a film like this; but instead they are non-existent and that ensures the plot is not very interesting either. As the title would suggest, there's a handful of hardcore sex scenes thrown in; but they're not very well filmed either, which really makes this a rather torrid seventy three minutes of film viewing. Not surprisingly, this is a rare film and it's one that is not worth tracking down.",Others,,

This is a movie that appeals to disgusting bottom-feeders. You can tell that the person who wrote it never graduated high school.<br /><br />The acting is sooo bad. Willem Defoe, listening to music, while walking around the crime scene, at the beginning of the movie, was almost worth seeing this garbage: You will laugh so hard your stomach will hurt. Actually, there's another crime scene investigation, almost as funny as the first: Defoe gets so worked up that he sweats, tears his shirt and fires his gun in the air- AT A CRIME SCENE! My friends and I laughed so hard we were all crying. It was so bad.<br /><br />Even the action scenes are so ridiculous that people stand in plain view, 15 feet away of each other, shoot for 30 seconds straight and no one gets shot! Also the 'saints/nazis' walk in to a courthouse with guns by throwing the bag that's carrying them over a metal detector! It's so stupid that it's hilarious!<br /><br />The writing is horrible! You can tell that troy duffy isn't a very intelligent person. He believes...get this (LOL!): that having people go around killing drug dealers, etc, is a good thing!

"I loved ""Phantasm"" of 1979, and i liked the first sequel ""Phantasm II"" of 1988 a lot. ""Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead"" of 1994 was quite poor in comparison, but i was still entertained. This third sequel, ""Phantasm IV: Oblivion"", however, has hardly any positive aspects. This film's only qualities are Angus Scrimm as the Tall Man and Reggie Bannister as Reggie. These two actors still deliver good performances as the Phantasm series' two memorable characters. Even those two characters have become a lot weaker though. The film tells a lot about the Tall Man's background, which takes a lot of this wonderful Horror villain's creepiness away. The character of Reggie also becomes less likable, since director Coscarelli obviously found it necessary for this formerly very cool character to annoy with 'hip' one-liners. Still, it is Bannister and Scrim who are responsible for the only few good moments in this film.<br /><br />Other than these two, the movie delivers one disappointment after another. Due to the total lack of new ideas, Coscarelli just decided to put in several scenes that were cut out from the great 1979 original. These recycled scenes basically serve as flashbacks - as flashbacks that don't make any sense and seem extremely out of place. The main purpose of ""Phantasm IV"" seems to be to recycle ideas from its predecessors. Even worse, the film destroys a lot of what the previous movies had built up. Even the super-creepy Tall Man's creepiness is destroyed by an idiotic story about his background. Not only is ""Phantasm IV: Oblivion"" an unworthy sequel to the brilliant first, and cool second part, it is not even a worthy sequel to the, already poor, ""Lord Of The Dead"". Another sequel is scheduled for 2008, and now that I've seen all other parts of the series, I'll give it a try (It can't be worse than part 4). To those who enjoyed the first 3 ""Phantasm"" films, and haven't seen number 4 yet, I recommend to skip this sorry attempt of a sequel, since all it does is destroy some of the magic of is predecessors.",Visual Effect,Directional Techniques,
"Gloomy Sunday - Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod directed by Rolf Schübel in 1999 is a romantic, absorbing, beautiful, and heartbreaking movie. It started like Jules and Jim; it ended as one of Agatha Christie's books, and in between it said something about love, friendship, devotion, jealousy, war, Holocaust, dignity, and betrayal, and it did better than The Black Book which is much more popular. It is not perfect, and it made me, a cynic, wonder in the end on the complexity of the relationships and sensational revelations, and who is who to whom but the movie simply overwhelmed me. Perfect or not, it is unforgettable. All four actors as the parts of the tragic not even a triangle but a rectangle were terrific. I do believe that three men could fell deeply for one girl as beautiful and dignified as Ilona in a star-making performance by young Hungarian actress Erica Marozsán and who would not? The titular song is haunting, sad, and beautiful, and no doubt deserves the movie been made about it and its effect on the countless listeners. I love the movie and I am surprised that it is so little known in this country. It is a gem.<br /><br />The fact that it is based on a story of the song that had played such important role in the lives of all characters made me do some research, and the real story behind the song of Love and Death seems as fascinating as the fictional one. The song was composed in 1930s by Rezsö Seress and was believed to have caused many suicides in Hungary and all over Europe as the world was moving toward the most devastating War of the last century. Rezsö Seress, a Jewish-Hungarian pianist and composer, was thrown to the Concentration Camp but survived, unlike his mother. In January, 1968, Seress committed suicide in Budapest by jumping out of a window. According to his obituary in the New York Times, ""Mr. Seres complained that the success of ""Gloomy Sunday"" actually increased his unhappiness, because he knew he would never be able to write a second hit."" <br /><br />Many singers from all over the world have recorded their versions of the songs in different languages. Over 70 performers have covered the song since 1935, and some famous names include Billie Holiday, Paul Robeson, Pyotr Leschenko (in Russian, under title ""Mratschnoje Woskresenje""), Bjork, Sarah McLachlan, and many more. The one that really got to me and made me shiver is by Diamanda Galás, the Greek born American singer/pianist/performer with the voice of such tragic power that I still can't get over her singing. Galás has been described as ""capable of the most unnerving vocal terror"", and in her work she mostly concentrates on the topics of ""suffering, despair, condemnation, injustice and loss of dignity."" When she sings the Song of Love and Death, her voice that could've belonged to the most tragic heroines of Ancient Greece leaves no hope and brings the horror and grief of love lost forever to the unbearable and incomparable heights.<br /><br />8.5/10",Plot,Directional Techniques,

It stars a young Tom Hanks, before his success as an actor, at a time when he was doing mostly comedy. He plays Allen Bauer, a New York boy who as a child fell off a boat and nearly drowned but was rescued by a mysterious mermaid (Daryl Hannah). Years later as an adult, he and his brother Freddie (John Candy) reside and work in New York City as product shipping men by a pier. As fate would have it, Allen reunites with the beautiful mermaid. Lost, confused, mute and nude, he takes her in as a guest in his apartment and later as a lover. She learns English through watching television and avoids revealing her true identity as a mermaid. When she is out of water, she is human (with legs) and when she is wet, she becomes a mermaid. Now, for today's young audience, one will note the similarities to the recent film ""Aquamarine"". Turns out Aquamarine is inspired by this film, but Splash is the greater film. The screenplay, the work of three talents, is witty, comedic and yet touchingly romantic. Despite the fantasy element, and even fantasy-within-fantasy (the mermaid couldn't talk and then learned English after one day at Bloomingdale's ?) is still a work of complete order and balance. We really do believe that this is logically happening in 1980's New York City. Ron Howard's direction is equally superb. Tom Hanks is doing a fine job, but he is not doing anything challenging. Neither is John Candy, who is clearly just doing the thing he was best known for. But we have to take in mind that this was not a serious romance and it was the first of many romantic comedies that would gradually take over film. The 1980's saw many romantic comedies that would become classics. Moonstruck with Cher for instance. Unfortunately, Splash did not make a big splash at the time of its release. The ending was a bit of a surprise and too sugary-sweet as Tom Hanks leaves the mortal world behind for her. So while this film is not a classic per se, it is a fine document of 80's comedy. And they used to make them a lot better than they do now. This is a lovely romantic film and one that can be appreciated by the whole family. With music by Lee Holrdige that is very moving and splendid cinematography by Donald Peterman. This is, by the way, also quite a date movie.",Performance,Plot,Visual Effect

There's no way they could be genetically linked, their only connection is that they were both great actors. Also, the guy that Will had the bet with; I can't work out if he was supposed to be Australian with a bad American accent or an American with a bad Australian accent? And why not just go for an Aussie or an American, instead of trying to make one of them into another? There were a couple of other continuity problems - which are perfectly excusable for a first-time director, but this film could have been so much better if more attention had been paid to the basics (like not having a dark-haired, dark-eyed, shorter actor playing the father of a - well, let's just say a man that he could not genetically be related to). This film could have been so much better, with a little more attention to detail.

Which reminds me, why is it called ""I Still Know What You Did LAST Summer""? Sorry, Ben Willis, you're a couple of years behind. Anyway, for a reason I have yet to figure out, Jennifer Love Hewitt runs in the rain wearing a sweater and bikini bottom to tell Brandy and the rest of the victims that she ran over Ben Willis 2 years prior and that he went after her and Ray and killed 2 of her friends last year. In one seen, that I think is incredibly stupid, Jennifer's character is in a tanning machine when the psychotic Gordon's fisherman locks her in with one of those cable ties and turns the machine to full blast. As stupid as her friends are, they waste time breaking the machine when they could simply pull the plug. HELLO? Anyway, people die, killer dies, the end.

The thing is that Astaire is unable to accept his growing old and his shooting abilities not being what they used to so, to build up his confidence once more, the trio convince him to accept the badge of town marshal with them as his deputies! However, Astaire deludes himself further into thinking that the roughnecks who come into town eventually leave it because of his notoriety (rather than through the helpful 'armed and invisible' presence of his friends) and even befriends a much younger saloon gal who turns out to be the girl of the robber behind the crime Astaire was supposed to have committed in the first place! The quintet of Hollywood veterans provide the only pleasure to be had from this meager production because whenever they are offscreen things get pretty dull indeed.",Plot,Performance,
"I love non-sequitur humor. There's nothing like watching Peter Griffin pop off, ""Like that one time..."" or watching Cartman say something stupid again. Robot Chicken has some of the best non-sequitur humor I've ever watched or heard, only Family Guy ranks higher in the non-sequitur humor. There's really no plot in Robot Chicken. Seth Green (Austin Powers Trilogy, Family Guy) voices many of Robot Chicken characters (along with a bunch of cameo appearances by celebrities) in random skits. For example in one scene you see a snail riding a turtle exclaiming, ""WEEEEEE!"". The next scene could be something as random. You really never know hat to expect while watching this show. Robot Chicken is a great show to watch when you just want to kick back and watch something on TV without having to think that much about the plot. Five stars!",Visual Effect,,
"While it's of infinitely better quality than the T&A show that is Ghost Whisperer (who would've thought skimpy outfits + ghost mysteries would actually be boring), I still was not impressed much by this show. It's just....too full of cliché's. The tough, honest cop father, the hippie gypsy mother, the star athlete brother (who's facing a crisis that interrupted his perfect life), the nerd super-genius brother, etc.<br /><br />While all of these caricatures would've been great if this were a Monty-Python-ish tongue-in-cheek show, I get the feeling that they (the producers) are actually serious! It's long, drawn out and slow like a typical CSI-ish drama with just a not-so-subtle hint of religious preaching now and then (discounting testimony's from ""God"", since we'd expect that, but the ""it's only logical to believe in God"" speech from the nerd-brother?).<br /><br />All in all, it's not a badly produced show, per se. One can tell that it's got a good crew behind it. But there's something missing amongst the decent acting (mostly), good props, set, lighting, cast, etc. It needs an interesting story.",Plot,Directional Techniques,
"I saw this movie in German club and I thought it was really entertaining. Sure, it wasn't the height of intellectual humor by any stretch of the imagination, but it was still pretty damn funny. I know doing a spoof of a fairy tale isn't the most original or deep idea for a movie, but I think the way they went about it (with the he-dwarf woman haters club in the forest, the usurping nurse who became queen just by putting on the crown, how Schneewittchen ended up with the jester at the end) was a lot better than it could've been. Of course, I was mostly just happy that I could understand the jokes. My favorite part was the whole ""Schach"" bit, I still giggle when I think about it sometimes. I also liked how they did the brunette/blond jokes, I thought that was actually kind of clever. The cinematography was pretty nice to look at, too, very spoof-y and bright. I loved the music, it was so bubbly and catchy! I wish I could find the soundtrack.",Plot,,
"Ever been to a film where you are looking at your watch within the first 5 minutes?<br /><br />Sadly this film looks great from the trailer and has the relevant kiddie appeal - so we took our son (who loves Finding Nemo) and all of us were deeply disappointed.<br /><br />The very poor animation looks like this was made in someone's bedroom (actually I think now you could do a better job at home) and the storyline is nearly non existent. Half the time I thought the projector was out of focus, but no, it is just made that poorly.<br /><br />The characters sound and look wooden, there is none of the 'shine' that a film like Nemo has. Characters also appear out of nowhere with no explanation.... granted the audience is young, but they aren't stupid!<br /><br />It is sad to see how a film like this can be made against the fabulous work and care that someone like Pixar put into animated stories, this is just rubbish, and I wouldn't bother going to see it - save the £20 or so it will cost you, buy some popcorn and watch something decent in your own home on DVD",Others,,
"I have just seen ""Hear and Now"" on HBO. I regret to say that my comments cannot be positive because anyone seeing this documentary would be profoundly discouraged about the possibility of a successful cochlear implant. It did not work for the couple in the film for a variety of reasons, none of which is discussed. It is much too easy for people to become discouraged because of this kind of movie. Here are a couple of experiences that have occurred that do not project the discouraging outlook of the people in the film.<br /><br />(1) One and one-half years (2006) ago one of my first cousins who had been profoundly deaf for at least 25 years had a cochlear implant. Her four sons tell me they are overjoyed that they can now carry on a conversation with their mother.<br /><br />(2) After my cousin's successful implant, I then told one of my best friends about the implant surgery. This friend had been unable to converse with others even with the most powerful hearing aids available. She and her husband had been misinformed by an audiologist about her eligibility for surgery. When she went to the hearing institute in the city we live in, physicians not only said she was eligible, but performed the procedure September 2007. This week-end my friend was at two parties given for one of my sons and she was able to engage in give and take conversation with all of the guests. She is now going to have an implant in the other ear.<br /><br />If I had seen this film and was eligible for an implant, I would have been terribly discouraged.<br /><br />The film did not present a balanced view.",Plot,,
"Little prepares the average US film watcher for this one. Is it Japanese over the top violence? No. Is it Japanese S & M sex perversions? No. Is it just general Japanese cultural stuff that doesn't translate well? Not really. What is it?<br /><br />The only thing I knew about the film was that it was about two musicians making found object music after some major crisis in the near future. What sort of music? I knew what a lot of found object music sounds like but the two musicians featured here were totally unknown to me. The first real clue was a prominently displayed ""Borbetomagus"" sticker. If you don't know who that is, look them up, ""art noise"" is a generous description. The musicians (and some will question that) are given large amounts of time where they perform their noise generation (including guitars and synthesizers). I have an appreciation for this type of sound experimenting and was involved with the US art noise scene in it's infancy in the late 1970's and early 80's. Unfortunately the performances in the film are dull except for the final extended solo which is excellent. To have such a well made film revolving around this type of sound would be unheard of in the US.<br /><br />The plot is simply that the only people infected with the ""Lemming Syndrome"" who survive have attended concerts by the two musicians. A wealthy man tries to convince the musicians to cure his suicidal daughter. That's about it. <br /><br />Slowly paced but extremely beautiful. A wonderful music track when the noise is not happening. Subdued but good performances from everyone. A couple of scenes were baffling to me and I don't understand the Biblical reference or why the music group is named ""Stepin Fetchit"". <br /><br />This review is a recommendation and a warning.",Plot,Music,Visual Effect
"I gave this movie 9 stars out of Ten, only because the story line resembles other flicks like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Timber Falls. I went and seen this at a theater when they they had the After Dark Horrorfest playing, and I was really impressed. I went into it thinking that its gonna be a cheesy gore-fest, but it proved me wrong. I mean it had some bloody and violent parts, but it actually is a decent flick. The acting was decent, especially for the fact that the actors weren't really known. When three sisters Kelsey Crane, Kelsey Weeden(Detour) and Tara Gerard inherit some property deep in the country, they and a group of their friends Alex A. Quinn, Malea Richardson, Vanessa Viola and Jim Devotti decide to take a weekend off and check it out.

"*SPOILERS!!!!!!* (but then, who'd care with this!)<br /><br />I bought this title for a relative as a joke present, keeping the 50p price tag on it. Little did I realize how bad it was, and they insisted, in the most sarcastic fashion, that i should view it too. Oh dear...<br /><br />The best bit of this film is the opening sequence, loosely tying it in as a sequel to another film which appears to have nothing to do with this one! It offers a couple of inept chuckles, but the fun stops there.<br /><br />I cannot find a single redeeming feature in this film. There are no campy moments, there aren't even any moments of unintentional laughter, it really is that bad!<br /><br />There is no excitement, the script is cringingly embarrassing (there are some truly poor attempts too add some mysticism by reading 'The Jabberwocky') And the monsters look awful. The plot is non-existent, and there are huge swathes of the film that involve nothing but people walking across bits of scrub land, with some terrible keyboard music.<br /><br />This is a terrible film, don't see it.

"I love Sarah Michelle Gellar, she is capable of fantastic acting as made clear in the Buffy series. She has, unfortunately, been given no opportunities to show her considerable talent in film. While Cruel Intentions is a bad movie, Harvard Man is one of the worst - if not the worst - movie I have ever forced myself to sit through. The writing is practically non-existent. There are many scenes of back and forth dialogue with little purpose but to fill time. There are several simultaneous plots (gambling, drug addiction, sexual cheating, dealing with the mob), none of them interesting in their execution. There is no coherence - each plot thread seems forced in to fill time and is not interwoven with a big theme. One soon gets the feeling that the movie was started with little passion from the director, then finished in a hurry to meet a deadline. Harvard Man is transparently what it is: a quickly-made attempt to capitalize on Gellar's fame. To watch it is to wait for its end, amazed that such a thing actually made it as a major motion picture. I CAN'T believe the average rating here is close to 5. Anyone who says this movie is anything but awful is either mentally deficient or has an agenda. The only reason to watch this movie is to gawk at its atrociousness.",Performance,Visual Effect,

The deal includes trying out a medication that will erase the harmful tendencies of the convicts past, trying to make him a better person for society.<br /><br />I gave it a chance but after about 30 minutes, I realized this story was formed around a single idea and the rest was just filled in along the way. That characters are underdeveloped and you never really get a liking for any of them. Then before you know it, its over, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />The film feels like a movie of the week based on a cheap page turning novel you pick up before you get on an airplane.<br /><br />Unfortunately Liotta and Dafoe don't help.

"Today, after eighteen long years, Elwood Blues has finally paid his debt to society and was being released from prison. After being escorted outside, he stood beside the road, eagerly awaiting his brother Jake to pick him up. Several hours go by and Jake had not arrived. Elwood waited until the next morning, when the warden finally came out and told him the awful news: Jake had passed away. Elwood received a ride home from Matara, a colleague of his old bandmember Willie. Once back in town, Elwood went to Malvern Gasperon's used car lot and set his sites on a classic police cruiser, similar to the one he had in the last adventure. But it was gonna cost $500, which he didn't have. Next, Elwood visits Mother Mary Stigmata at the new orphanage, since the old one had long since been demolished. Right away, Elwood learns that his old buddy Curtis had died. He also learns that Curtis had an illegitimate son. That's also when Elwood meets a young, sarcastic orphan named Buster. Mother Mary wanted Elwood to spend some time with the youngster--whether he wanted to or not.<br /><br />Elwood attempted to ditch the kid, though unsuccessfully, and seek out Curtis' son. He found him at the police station. He was Commander Cabel ""Cab"" Chamberlain. Elwood introduced himself, then told his ""sort-of brother"" that he was thinking of putting the band back together and asked if he'd like to join. He also asks to borrow $500 for a car. But Cab had the goods on Elwood and his late brother Jake. He refused, and personally kicked him out of the office. Outside, Buster picked his pocket and gave the wallet to Elwood, which ironically contained $500. So, Elwood purchased the police cruiser then he and Buster go for a very slow cruise. They stop off at Willie's strip club to try and convince Willie rejoin the band. Willie was hesitant, because the Russian mafia was watching him. But, Elwood and the bartender, Mack McTeer, bound and gag two Russian mobsters and leave them in the alley. This did not sit well with their leader, who demanded vengeance against Elwood and Willie; Elwood gives Mack an opportunity to perform at the club and sees he has talent. Just then, the Russians arrive and shoot up the club, then torch it. Luckily all the strippers, patrons, Matara, Elwood, Mack, Willie and Buster escape in time. Mack and Willie join the band. Next, Elwood tracks down the other members of the band: Matt ""Guitar"" Murphy, Donald ""Duck"" Dunne, Tom ""Bones"" Malone, Murph, Mr. Fabulous, and ""Blue Lou"" Marini and, in his own crude and crass way, convinces them to rejoin. Elwood even had Mack and Buster fitted with their own Blues suits. Now, all they needed was a gig. Unbeknownst to them, the Illinois state police and the Russian mafia were after them.<br /><br />Maury Sline, their old booking agent, managed to book them a gig at a county fair in Kentucky, and, an opportunity to play at Queen Mousette's Battle of the Bands at her club in Louisiana. So, Elwood, Mack and Buster in the new Bluesmobile, and the band in tow, hit the road. Always managing to stay one step ahead of a furious Cab and the entire Illinois police force. They play at the fair in Kentucky, but learned they wanted a bluegrass band, and not a blues band. So they played bluegrass, blues style. All the while Cab and the cops watched the stage, but monster trucks and a storm proved the perfect distraction; the Blues brothers and the band manage to elude the cops at a local tent revival, with the Reverend Cleophus James. When Cab arrived, something extraordinary happened. It was a miracle, some say. He had a revelation. His destiny became clear. He donned a nifty Blues outfit and joined the band. But the rest of the police force weren't buying it, so they chased the Blues Brothers band all the way to Louisiana where they competed in Queen Mousette's Battle of the Bands--and lost to the Louisiana Gator Boys. Well before long, Elwood and the gang found themselves surrounded by every cop in a thousand mile radius, as well as the Russian mafia. And worst of all, Mother Mary Stigmata! There was nothing left to do but run. Buster had a plan. While Mack and Cab created a diversion on stage, Elwood and Buster made a run for it in the Bluesmobile followed by a very long cavalcade of police cars.<br /><br />Blues Brothers 2000--what can I say? It was pretty good. It started off very properly with a proper dedication to John Belushi, Cab Calloway and John Candy. Dan Aykroyd returns as Elwood Blues, everyone's favorite crafty Blues con. John Goodman is on board as Mighty Mack McTeer. Joe Morton is Cab. J. Evan Bonifant is Buster. Frank Oz returns as the warden. And the late Kathleen Freeman returns as Mary Stigmata. Familiar faces Aretha Franklin and James Brown are here too. Belushi's absence from this film is definitely noticeable, but I think it's good they made Elwood a more central character, since in the original it was obvious Jake was the central character. They gave Elwood a chance to build. But personally, this wasn't much of a sequel, but rather a rehash of the first film. But if you liked the first film and would like to see a jazzy update, then Blues Brothers 2000 is for you. I recommend it. Like they say, the Lord works in mysterious ways.",Plot,Performance,

I find this rather unfortunate because I had been anticipating Shoot 'Em Up for quite some time and had heard many good things about it.<br /><br />The action was so redundant I was bored out of my mind. The dialogue was god awful and corny. It also failed as a comedy because I think there was only one (maybe two) parts where I laughed.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting a ton of plot or characterization going in but I was expecting an entertaining movie which this failed terribly at being. By all rights it feels like it was written by a high school student.<br /><br />So many plot holes are present and the director expects the audience to have way too many suspensions of disbelief. I understand something being over the top but when a filmmaker chooses to completely disregard reality, common sense, and psychics it's not only lazy but insulting.<br /><br />I was expecting something clever but instead got something dumb and trite.

"How Burt Freundlich continues to get movies made is astonishing. He's been a hack since his first feature and continues to be with this film. Even more astonishing is that he got an actress as luminous, intelligent and talented as Julienne Moore to not only appear in his hack films but to marry him to boot! (I'm guessing there's an on-set love child reason behind this.) She's probably responsible for gathering the rest of the usually talented cast to participate in what amounts to be a sub-high school level wanna-be's attempt at a Woody Allen homage. Freundlich does not know drama, does not know structure, couldn't write a script if it were ghost written for him and directs with a hand so leaden it's amazing the audience can walk out of the theater afterward in full consciousness. His films are just mind-numbing. This guy is no auteur. It must have been a slow year at Sundance when ""Myth of Fingerprints"" slipped through with such shining notices (and, for God's sake, how did he assemble THAT cast? Such talent, so wasted.)

Then there's the shots which look like they were shot on a faulty camcorder, I'm sorry but they are incredibly annoying as the screen becomes an absolute mess of pixelation & blocks. To add insult to injury director Almereyda uses various irritating techniques to try & convince the viewer that their watching 'art' like soft focus, blurring, slow motion, shots where the background action runs at a different speed to the foreground, jerkiness, skipping frames & bizarre scene transitions. I hated how Nadja looks & was literary praying it would finish within the first 30 minutes but never let it be said I don't give a film a chance & I (just about) stuck it out to the end which was also crap. With a pretty reasonable budget of about $1,000,000 Nadja is a poor show, very few character's, no effects & a cheap feel throughout & I have to ask myself where all the money went exactly. There is no atmosphere, scares or tension & while I accept some people may like this black and white art-house nonsense I don't & that's all that matters to me, I simply cannot see how anyone could gain any sort of viewing pleasure from such a film as this & I certainly didn't. There is not one single aspect of Nadja that I can say I enjoyed apart from the central performance by Romanian actress Lowensohn who makes for a striking & seductive female Vampire. Fonda just looks stupid sporting long hair & reflective shades. Forget about any special effects or any proper blood or gore. If you like this sort of bizarre boring, black and white art-house stuff then Nadja is probably right up your street so I can recommend it to you but if your looking for a proper film with decent horror & an actual story then avoid this piece of crap like the plague, that's just my opinion & I'm sure there is an audience out there for a film like Nadja but it's not for me.",Plot,Performance,Directional Techniques
"What can one say about a TV show whose main objective is to be as deliberately awful as possible, and that somehow is supposed to be brilliant comedy? I barely made it through this disc, and I was astonished at how truly awful this stuff is. The only time I laughed out loud was when John C. Reilly showed up as Dr. Bruse. Reilly is a very good actor, and it was the only time during the show that I actually laughed heartily. If I was John's agent, I would recommend to him not to do this show anymore, as it belittles him as an actor and artist. Fred Willard also shows up, and while I love Mr. Willard's work, he can't rescue the scene he's in, which is pretty lame. The series isn't completely devoid of laughs, but aside from John Reilly's work, I laughed maybe 3 times during the whole season. The series is more creepy than funny. <br /><br />It's a pretty poor indication of a show's quality when the episodes are a mere 11 minutes long, and I kept checking the DVD to see when it was going to be over. The eleven minutes seem longer than Gone With the Wind at times. The targets of the satire seem to be local cable commercials, which are actually funnier than most of the stuff here. The ""gravy robbers"" is one of the dumbest (not ""funny dumb"") sketches I ever saw. The ""editing"", if one can call it that, is not done with any rhyme or reason, even in an artistic sense. It's all just random, and it isn't funny or interesting. <br /><br />This is not brilliant comedy, as some say here. I'm getting really tired of people simply thinking since this show (and others of its ilk) polarise people, that automatically makes its art. Some nimrod here on IMDb actually compared this show to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, in terms that when The Rite of Spring first appeared, the audience was shocked at the performance of it, and it split the audience. That comparison is so mind bogglingly off that one staggers at it. A couple of rules of life... <br /><br />1. Just because something is controversial doesn't make it brilliant. 2. Just because something isn't mainstream doesn't mean it's good. 3. Just because something like this is weird doesn't make it good. 4. Just because someone doesn't like this doesn't mean they watch Friends or Two and a Half Men. 5. Just because something polarises people doesn't make it art. <br /><br />Some have said it's deliberately surreal, but it isn't. It's just lazy and incoherent. It has some similar qualities to MTV2's Wonder Showzen, except Wonder Showzen had some real creative transitions in the first season (the 2nd season wasn't as good...the drugs they took must have worn off). I think many who think this show is some sort of misunderstood artistic masterpiece are just reading way too much into it, and it's the product of their own imaginations rather than any brilliance on the part of Tim and Eric.",Plot,Performance,Others
"I went to see this movie prompted by critics that placed it up there in the pantheon of masterpieces. Never was I let down this much before! Apart from the on going dialogues that may or may not be profound or interesting, the art of cinema is not really present. I believe good cinema is what makes you want to see a movie again and again even if you do not follow the story/stories. ""Breathless"" is such a movie. This one isn't. When characters seem far more intelligent than those behind the camera we have a failure. It is as if they have escaped the movie-making process and every directors attempt to control his material seems futile.",Directional Techniques,Others,
"this will be very biased - I love this series and practically know it by heart. When my video tape was wrecked from rewinding, I finally got myself the DVD... and still love to watch it.<br /><br />This is the most complete adaption of the novel, and there are so many lovable details in it that just make it a very unique movie experience. There are however minor changes, due to the fact that each episode of the series had to be leaving the audience wanting more... but nothing that really differs from the original.<br /><br />The actors are awesome - Colin Firth is and will be the one and only Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle was a wonderful Elizabeth - spirited, lively, yet still always within decorum ( only that her skirts were "" 6 inches deep in mud, I assure you""). Jane is, although maybe not for our standards pretty, a very classic beauty, and very much in character.The Bingley sisters are wonderfully arrogant, and Bingley is such a nice guy - not the insipid undecided, but rather too much trusting those he holds dear. Mrs Bennet, though annoying, is wonderful, and Mr. Bennet, witty and sarcastic, a perfect choice....in short, the complete cast has so decidedly imprinted upon my image of the characters that I find it hard to imagine anyone else playing that particular role.<br /><br />The movie works very efficiently and elegantly with flashbacks to tell the various sub-plots, yet remains focused on the main actions. The scenery is well made, and the costumes are beautiful. I liked the fact that each actor had a wardrobe just as they would have had had they lived in the time, and not a new dress for each new scene.<br /><br />For us, it may be hard to acquaint oneself with the language of Jane Austen, the rules of decorum of her time, and the social standards and sets of rules. In watching the movie, a lot of these things come clear - visualization as a means of understanding the regency period.<br /><br />On a last note - the music is awesome. I have the opening melody as my cellphone ring ever since my Cellphone was able too...;) <br /><br />There are so many little details, over which discussions can be lead for hours and hours, or pages and pages, and this s one of the best parts about the movie - although it gives an interpretation, it is not finite.

"One of Disney's masterpieces, a true work of art was brought back to life. I loved the loyalty of this sequel, to the original drawings and voices. The characters are endearing and there is added humor in this movie. Thumper's personality has been rounded up more and the beauty and dignity of the forest and the deer in the forest is unspoiled. In my opinion, it is a keeper. The music, though, leaves much to be desired. It would have been more respectful regarding the artistic value of the movie, to have richer music written for it. It was mediocre music and it didn't take away from the movie itself because the animation was so true to the majestic original. I believe that Disney had a keen pedagogic sense. Through his media resources he taught his young audiences (even the young at heart) to appreciate cultural manifestations: Music, a very notorious one. So this is how Disney's aim fails in Bambi II. It doesn't really teach the ear, so to speak, to appreciate the sonic expressions in its music.",Music,Visual Effect,Others
"<br /><br />I just finished seeing Fulltime Killer. What a pleasant surprise. 2 months ago, I was sorely disappointed with the flicks that H.K churned out. Apparently, i was tired of watching every action directors in H.K imitating Tsui Hark, John Woo, Ringo Lam, and Johnny To. Every movie I saw, there was that typical shaky cameras, and sweeping movements, making everything seemed cooler than it actually is. Even the Greats imitated themselves in such mess as Zu Warriors. But then I saw Shaolin Soccer, and that shook my disturbed belief a bit. And today, I saw Fulltime Killer, and my faith in H.K is fully restored. I know that Fulltime Killer is nothing original, compared to the action classics such as ""the Killer"", but it was done right for once. I found myself lost in Johnny To's perspective of this excellent story. In the end, I took what seemed like the first breath since the opening of the film. Apparently I had a very good time. I was certainly pleasantly surprised. I found that every actors did their jobs well. Andy Lau, who always seemed a bit feminine to me fit the role well, and made it work. I was impressed with Takeshi's performance. Although his role seemed very stereotypical and slightly less demanding, he made it work well. I found myself in awe with Kelly Lin's portrayal of the innocent girl. The action scenes were very well done. Although they were noting revolutionary as the recent films ""crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""time and Tide"", but I found them incredibly effective. The Music was certainly the highlight of the film. Its haunting theme weave in well with the scenes, and made them alive. All in All.... not the most original, but at this day and age, it's almost impossible to find originality. Very fun time, and quite a pleasant surprise.",Performance,Others,
"Far better than American shows of the same type (Saturday Night Live)which spend more time showing political leanings than just being funny. L Britain is very funny--a bit more male kissing than I care to see--but the skits are very well done. As odd as it may seem, the funniest skit to me is the shortest, the politician holding the press conference in front of his home explaining the latest misunderstood sex scandal.

"Van Wilder 2 does not have the character 'Van Wilder' from the first film in any scene. One would expect such a film to be bad. What is notable about this film is that it is not only bad, but it is as bad in relation to the rather low quality first film as this fact would imply.<br /><br />Van Wilder 2 is a clear cross between the first ""Van Wilder"", and the classic '80s college frat film ""Revenge of the Nerds"". Since ""Van Wilder"" (1) had a poor plot, a person might expect that this could be an improvement, but the crossbreeding is driven solely by the lack of creativity in the writers. Beyond a cursory plot, the film lacked dramatic tension, has poor plot detail execution, a distinct 'gag' or prank shortage, and inherently weak and under-characterized supporting characters.<br /><br />I had high hopes of Kal Penn, and in fact I cannot fault his performance (as opposed to his choice of roles) but the film, and his role is so weak that this counts for little. A film of this sort requires interesting, if often two-dimensional supporting characters, and while Lauren Cohen, the female lead, does a creditable job, the rest of the supporting acting is rather bad.<br /><br />To sum up, a very poor film, and a nearly humor-free comedy.",Directional Techniques,Plot,Performance
"One of the most faithful nuns in her convent, Sister Maria finds herself obsessed by the Devil. Obsessed, not possessed, because Satan is an external force in this film. A strapping and vampiric lad, the Devil brings out Sister Maria's inner desires for both sex and blood. Plagued also by her devotion to God, she tries to fight these forbidden desires and lusts with prayer and penitence only to have them come back ten fold. Sister Maria is suddenly caught between Satanic submission or death.<br /><br />Satanico Pandemonium is a good nunsploitation effort in the vein of, the more celebrated, Juan Lopez Moctezuma'a Alucarda. It has sex, nudity, lesbianism, child seduction, self mutilation, blood, and death(not necessarily in that order, of course).

"Is it just me or is Chuckie's ax always slightly out of tune? I really enjoyed this film and learned a lot about Berry, his past, the career, and a sometimes tyrannical attitude. Not to much on his arrest or marital life; Chuck nipped that in the bud before it got off the ground. A lot of good footage is offered of the band rehearsing and then giving a sensational concert featuring several other artists. Also the viewer is treated to several interviews by various recording artists. Clearly, Berry is an out of the ordinary man, likeable in many ways, but a bit hard to swallow at times. I felt his attempt to change keys in the middle of a song during the performance was an amateur stunt at best.

"Poorly written, this film has the thinnest and most ridiculous ""plot"" I've ever seen. The acting (even from the Duke) is also sub-par from such a cast. I think that Janet Leigh actually out-acts Wayne. I can't see much to commend this film. A defecting Soviet pilot (Leigh) is given a totally free rein (no detention, no interrogation, nothing!) and even allowed to fly modern US jet fighters, watched only by Wayne's character, who has fallen for her. This film is too laughable to be called anything other than a comedy. However, it wasn't shot, edited or released as a comedy. It was designed as a pure propaganda film. As such, it's a total failure. This thing's a complete waste.",Plot,Performance,Others

Maggie is a sad ,lonely, middle-aged frump who spent her life just plodding along. Her life's greatest humiliation somehow turned into a hope for better future all around. It would be impossible to tell this highly unusual story without creative actors. Marianne Faithful may not be the greatest actress in the world, but in this part she fits the bill perfectly.

"In 1915 Chaplin produced fourteen films for Essanay, just over a third of his output for the previous year under the conveyor belt-like production values of Keystone. This was a trend that would continue, with Chaplin's quantity shrinking more and more each year until the two-features-a-decade of his final years. However, with this shrink in output, the quality would increase, with massive advancement in the artistry of his work.<br /><br />This said, the Essanay shorts, while more inventive, better plotted and better realised than the Keystone work, initially aren't all that better. A case in point is The Champion, still a relatively primitive piece that has no great meaning or comedic punch (pun unintended). It's worth remembering that this was still only twenty years since the emergence of the first extensive film productions, and that it would have been sophisticated in its day. Yet despite this, the lack of continuity between internal/external locations and lapses of plot logic (Chaplin's Tramp becomes a feared boxer because he has a horseshoe in his glove later he is able to perform the same feats of knock out artistry without the horseshoe, which makes no sense at all) do pall somewhat.<br /><br />Probably most notable for inspiring a sequence in ""City Lights"", this is still the era of large comedy moustaches and lack of screen realism. While comedy can be exaggerated, with nothing to ground it in any form of reality it has no great currency over 90 years on. Thankfully the Essanay shorts began, most notably from ""The Tramp"" on, to develop Chaplin's character as a more sympathetic and socially relevant persona; the seeds of which can be seen here, with a more likable take than Chaplin had previously indulged in. In all, The Champion is interesting as a historical document and notable for the rapid progression Chaplin was making. On its own terms though, it isn't terribly good.",Plot,Performance,Others
"When Charlie Chaplin made his great black comedy of murders, ""Monsieur Verdoux"" he planned a sequence where Henri Verdoux contacts a woman through the matrimonial ads of a newspaper, only to discover she is a female serial killer for profit. When they find out each other's true vocation it becomes a race to kill the other, that Verdoux barely wins. However, this sequence was never in the finished film. One wonders how it would have been handled by Chaplin. I suspect it might have been good.<br /><br />Ray Steckler was nowhere near the Chaplin class of director and film creator. He is nearer Ed Wood, but Wood had that saving grace of having some concept or idea that was original but that he could not bring to the screen due to poor talent. Steckler was basically an opportunist who shot films that were violent and full of quasi-pornography. He never could do a nude sequence of interest. He just could show sleazy situations. It was enough to attract an audience, but its not cinematic art at it's best (Chaplin) or it's worst (Wood).<br /><br />The plot of this film is fairly simple: Johnny Click (that is his name) is a photographer played by Peter Agostino. He has been married but the marriage is now over, and he is a bitter man due to that. He looks at most of the women he meets as tramps and prostitutes, and since he is in Hollywood he does see many of them on the street corners. With a better script and direction it could be the negative version of Julia Roberts-Richard Gere's ""Pretty Women"", the street nightmare of the whores that Roberts wants to get away from. But this is Stekler, and he concentrates on the sensational that will make the film a ticket seller to a certain audience that just likes sensation. I will give him one credit though - his shots of the streets of Hollywood are done well, and the more to his credit is the cheapness of his film equipment: Steckler made this film as a silent film with a shoulder held camera. Later (at prodding of distributors) Agostino does do some narrative.<br /><br />Agostino contacts whores and offers to do photos with them as models, showing their ""skills"" for his camera. And we see him do in all these poor girls by strangling them. We never see any police investigation (it would have meant a more involved script with more acting). Agostino sees every victim as a ""cock tease"" and he feels he is doing the race of men a favor by killing them. Actually we do sense he is really going off the deep end - at one point he follows a woman to her car and strangles her in the car.<br /><br />While his murders do make headlines he is sharing them with a second serial killer known as the Skidrow Slasher.* These are male derelicts who are found cut up and mutilated in the back rows of the streets at night. Again no police investigation is shown. But we are invited to see the party responsible. It is a pornography book store owner played by Steckler's real life wife Caroline Brandt. Apparently (we are never allowed into her mental state to see what her problem is) she sees the derelicts as the parasitic men threatening the race of women, and sees it her duty to destroy them.<br /><br />(*I hate to give a schlockmeister like Steckler any real credit for creative force, but I keep wondering if he first got the idea of the two killers from the notorious Zodiac murderer who operated in California in the 1970s, and was never caught, as well as the ""Hillside Strangler"", who was caught eventually.)<br /><br />You can see what is inevitable in this crappy film.<br /><br />Agostino goes into the book store one day, and his eyes and Brandt's meet. Now neither is really pleasant looking, but both are ""presentable"" and neat. Both have some ""good points"" that could overcome their negatives (Agostino never smiles, Brandt has a perennial stare in her eyes). Slowly they get to know each other and start judging each other as a classier type than they have known than others of each other's sex. They decide to go full scale into a deep relationship. And just as it is coming to fruition they realize just who each other is, and what each other does.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />Briefly their growing fondness (I really can't consider it love) turns into mutual contempt and hatred, ending with Agostino strangling Brandt to death while Brandt plunges her knife repeatedly into Agostino's belly stabbing him to death. She dies first, and he dies shortly after.<br /><br />Aside from the shock value of the murders (which frankly gets monotonous) and the film of the streets, it is a wretched film. I take it that it found it's audience, as Steckler would later do a second film with Agostino (playing the same role - hey didn't he die in this first picture - only playing it in Las Vegas). One can't pass this story by without also noting that it could have been improved in many ways. For instance, Brandt's knife could have been used by Agostino on her while she strangled him in a curious, if fitting reversal, of murder methods. But even with that it would have been a worthless bit of change for such a film. Really the best thing to say about such a film is one need never have to see it. I recommend to the readers they avoid it like the plague.",Plot,Performance,Others
"This movie was just too intentionally cheesy for me, as well as too lacking in real excitement or scares. And it's no surprise to find that Roger Corman, whose movies I just don't respond to, is the producer behind it all.<br /><br />The movie opens with this sales film detailing how these new robots will patrol the mall after it has closed and harpoon any burglars. Then there's a live demonstration in front of an audience, with real tension that the robot is going to malfunction and blow the guy away right on stage, a la the opening scene of Robocop and now I see that Robocop came out a year after this one. Coincidence? We may never know. I do know that I wished the robot HAD blown the guy away, but whatever. Then there's a marginally amusing montage of life if the mall circa 1986.<br /><br />Then we start getting introduced to the ""characters,"" composed of two sluts and a ""good girl,"" and two moron studs and a ""nerd guy."" Can you guess who ends up together? There are also various security and janitorial personnel on hand. Anyway, so there's a big electrical storm with tons of lightning that all strikes over and over in the same place, but without any rain. Characters outside during this time do not see any lightning, either. Such is the strangeness of this natural phenomena, I guess.<br /><br />Well, anyone who's seen Short Circuit, released the same year, or even Stealth this year, knows that if there's lighting within five miles of a robot, it will hit the robot and reprogram it to either learn what it means to be alive or to become an unstoppable killing machine. It is the latter in this case.<br /><br />So this security guard is all freaked out by the lightning, but as soon as it's over, he seems to think to himself ""Alright! Now I'm gonna look at some porn!"" and whips out a magazine. How come they're ALWAYS looking at the centerfold in these movies? There's nude pictures on the other pages too, ya know. Not that I KNOW, I mean, I've just HEARD. Anyway, as anyone who has ever seen a movie before knows, looking at a porn mag MEANS certain death, and this guy comes to a boring and abrupt end. Then more people die, as a way of stalling us before we start seeing the horny teens (all played by people appearing to be in their late 20s) get killed.<br /><br />The teens ""party"" at this frankly embarrassing event at which they have to pretend to be having fun while oblivious to the fact that there's only six of them there. In the background a song called ""Streetwalkin'"" plays. Then they all have sex, within plain view of each other, on the beds in the furniture store. Except for the good girl and nerdy boy, who just watch an old (Roger Corman) movie. The girl squeals and hides her face at a small explosion, saying she's easily scared, which I guess is supposed to function as character development.<br /><br />So, in one of the only amusing developments, one of the women goes all princessy and needs a smoke, of a certain brand, before she can start putting out (though it seemed like they already had done it, and I don't understand). She says ""I have to have a cigarette and I have to have one NOW!"" So the dippy guy has to go get one, and of course he gets killed. I tell you, the women in this movie made me very glad that I'm gay. Not that the guys are much better, but at least they're quieter, don't pretend at mood swings just to get attention, and will go get you cigarettes if you throw a hissy fit. Anyway, then the robot chases the woman who wanted the cigarettes and blows her head off in the film's grossest effect. From that point on it's all scream, chase, killing, blah, blah, blah, as the teens try to blow up the robots and escape.<br /><br />Big yawn. This movie is only 77 minutes, and even so there was a lot of fast-forwarding. For one, I just don't love these kinds of movies. For two, really clumsy robots can't do much except shoot and squeeze, so the deaths they are capable off aren't really that gory or scary or interesting. There is little to no actual ""chopping."" And the robots don't have much personality and certainly no motivation. And the whole thing just isn't as silly as it should be.

Meanwhile, Claire arrives in the night without previous notice, and when she sees Liva drinking wine with Kresten, she returns to Copenhagen. Kresten is fired by her father and she asks for the divorce. Kresten and Liva falls in love for each other, and Rud and Bjarke becomes friends, forming a weird family. This Dogma 95 film is a delightful Danish dramatic romance. The story is very nice, without being corny. The title of this movie is a game of samurai between Kresten and Rud, and a homage to Toshirô Mifune, the Kikuchiyo from `The Seven Samurai'.

"Stage Fright (1950)' certainly isn't one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films, but I like it  quite a lot, in fact. From 1949-1950, the Master of Suspense took a temporary break from Hollywood film-making and produced two UK productions, the first being 'Under Capricorn (1949),' a fascinating but relatively unengaging melodrama with superb camera-work. The second, a return to his standard narrative form after two noticeably experimental pictures, was an adaptation of the story ""Man Running"" by Selwyn Jepson. With a wonderful British supporting cast, centred around Hollywood stars Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich, the film has a distinctly British feel to it, and not just because of the actors and setting. Hitchcock's whimsical sense of humour, evident in a great many of his pictures, is allowed to permeate the traditional drama/romance storyline, and the film would certainly have felt comfortable alongside the Ealing comedies of the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of which employed darkly comedic overtones.<br /><br />There's something about Jane Wyman that immediately caught my eye while watching this film. Behind her rosy cheeks, timid eyes and soft voice, there's a certain innocence and vulnerability about her demeanour that really drew my sympathy. Her character, Eve Gill, is basically a petty schoolgirl, driven by silly but unwavering aspirations to uncover the truth, and her delicate personality is punctuated by moments of stubbornness, and, indeed, some occasional bravery. I've never really taken to actress Marlene Dietrich, and I find her distinct European accent and stunted line-delivery to be rather distracting; however, she does passably well as Charlotte Inwood, demonstrating an arrogant disposition that forms a strong contrast with the mild personality of Wyman's character. As far as the male actors are concerned, strong performances are given by Richard Todd as the wrongly-accused boyfriend {for some reason or another, the Irish actor reminded me of Joaquin Phoenix}, Michael Wilding as the honest and romantic detective with whom Eve inevitably falls in love, and Alastair Sim is a lot of fun as our leading lady's loving and playful father.<br /><br />In comparing Alfred Hitchcock's films with those of his contemporaries, it's interesting to note how the director made stunning, dynamic use of the camera. Both 'Rope (1948)' and 'Under Capricorn (1949)' had made pioneering use of long-takes, sweeping the camera across the room with astonishing style and grace. For the first time, Hitchcock {and cinematographer Wilkie Cooper} integrated these techniques into a more traditional film-making style, and multiple sequences play out in a single take; my favourite shot follows Cooper (Richard Todd) through Charlotte's front door, and smoothly rises with him as he ascends the staircase. Another interesting element to the film, which met with much criticism upon its release, is the ingenious use of a false flashback, as Cooper's recount of past events is revealed to be little more than an elaborate lie. As the anecdote was explicitly treated as Cooper's own version of events, I see little ""dishonesty"" in Hitchcock's clever manipulation of the audience, and the final twist certainly succeeded in taking me by surprise  though I probably should have noticed something amiss when the romance between Eve and Smith began to develop.",Performance,Directional Techniques,Plot
I loved this movie. It's too bad that Pamela Smart does not take any responsibility for any of her crimes and actions. She is as guilty as anyone can be. I'm glad she ran out of appeals and legal options and that her pardon was denied. She took them to the Federal level. She says she deserves leniency because she's been good in prison. I don't know about you but I think people are supposed to be good in prison. Chad Allen was great in this movie.<br /><br />Reasons Pamela smart is guilty: 1. She had an affair with a teenage boy.<br /><br />2. She is a sociopatic liar.<br /><br />3. She is cold hearted.<br /><br />4. She did not show any emotion when her husband was murdered.<br /><br />5. Denial.<br /><br />6. Knew everything about the crime.<br /><br />7. Jury and evidence found her guilty.,Performance,Plot,
"Like many of you, Id never heard the title Lady Snowblood before Kill Bill came out, so when I watched Kill Bill and saw Tarantino mention this film as one of his biggest influences, well I knew I would have to check it out sooner or later. So did Tarantino really rip off this flick or what? You bet your double edged sword he did! <br /><br />The story is about this couple who get mugged by these four thugs. The husbands gets the ax by the killers and the wife gets raped by all of them many times. When the lady kills one of the killers and slays him she ends up in jail pregnant with a bastard child. When the child is born the mother dies, but not before whispering into the childs ear that her only purpose in life will be to kill those who were responsible for the death of her family. That little girl is raised by a Kung Fu master and ends up being Lady Snowblood. A creature living only to avenge those who murdered her entire family.<br /><br />I wont say Tarantino isn't a genius on his own right the guy is one of my favorites, but when he gets inspired he sure knows where to get his inspiration from! There's many images lifted right off from this movie. Lets see the most notable of all rip offs is Oren Ishii who is no doubt molded after Lady Snowblood herself. Right down to her underground gangster deals and her ugly past. Right down to wanting to avenge her parents deaths. She chops heads and slices and dices like she means it! Blood sprays out in huge amounts in the same way that it sprays in Kill Bill, as if you just opened a sprinkler system to water your lawn. There's the four or five people that she has to kill which pop up in her mind every time she sees them, exactly the same way as in Kill Bill. And I mean exactly the same way, all four bad guys looking down at the camera as if the camera was on the floor! Lady Snowblood has a list of people she has to kill, I mean the similarities are astounding. But still, it didn't really bother me since I was enjoying this damn movie so much! The story is what really pulls you in. Its a fantastically woven revenge film to the Nth degree! I mean the level of hatred thats transferred onto Lady Snowblood when she is a child and the horrible things that happen to her spawn one of the most hatred filled characters that I have seen in a long time. Just like Beatrix Kiddo, Lady Snowblood (aka Yuki Kashima) stops at no ones plea of mercy. She executes her revenge no matter what circumstances have occurred or changed from the time of her parents death. Basically its a you did it now you pay for it kind of story. But with some wonderful characters and complications along the way.<br /><br />There were many excellent things about this movie but the most pivotal of all was the flawless direction brought on by Toshiya Fujita. I mean this movie was like ahead of its time or something. Or maybe thats just the way movies were made in the seventies and it raised to such cool levels in a natural way. But this film has all these visual gags and tricks that could have only been spawned from that glorious era known as the 70s. Many scenes show that this director took special care in making this movie special, like those scenes with Lady Snowblood walking in the snow with her dress filled with the blood of her victim.<br /><br />So even though this movie gets pretty gory and violent, visually Id say its very elegant. The music is also incredibly good, mixing traditional Asian music with this great theme song that Tarantino took from this very movie and placed it in his. The song adds an incredible emotion to the film, specially when you know what it says. Also of special notice is the movies excellent performances! From the whole cast we get nothing but credibility and sincerity in the acting. There's an excellent scene in which Yukis mother is giving birth and dying at the same time and the dialog and performance she gives was really something! If there's something I have to say that I didn't like its that the blood looked too red and too liquid. I mean, I know blood is liquid but not like water. Blood is thick and sticky and on this movie the blood looks a cartoonish red and flows like water which rested a couple of notches of credibility. But thats really nothing, the film is damn near perfect for me. Also don't go in expecting a Kung Fu movie cause this isn't a Kung Fu movie its a revenge movie. Don't get me wrong, there's swordplay involved and lots of violence. Decapitations, bodies split in half, hands cut off. But not necessarily any Kung Fu fights involved. So, lots of gore and slicing and dicing, but no Kung Fu.<br /><br />In conclusion, a very very kick ass film. This is were Kill Bill was born and Kill Bill was as good as it was because it was already ripping off an truly excellent film. So, yeah, Id say go out of your freaking way to get this movie as soon as you can and enjoy one of the coolest revenge films to come out of Asian cinema. Lady Snowblood will get revenge on you if you don't! (Corny way to end my review, I know) Rating: 5 out of 5",Others,Performance,
"The one thing that everyone already knows about the assassination of Trotsky is that he was killed with an ice pick. Well, in this film, he is killed with an ice axe. An ice pick, an ice axe, they're not the same. To be precise, he is killed with the pick side of a two-headed ice axe, but even then, that's still not an ice pick, which is something entirely different. So which was it really?<br /><br />The only reason I'm belabouring this very trivial point is that it results in the single decent piece of acting in this film, the reaction of Richard Burton as Trotsky as he is hit in the head with the axe. As you would probably imagine, you have to wait quite a while to get to this moment in the film.<br /><br />Other than Burton, the film's leads are Alain Delon and Romy Schneider. Neither one is comfortable speaking in English, the language they are required to use here. Most of their scenes are together. Why weren't their scenes done in French instead?<br /><br />Since the presumable market for a film about that old villain Trotsky would have to be the European Left, why was this film made in English in the first place? Why not French, the language of the leads, or Italian, the language of the crew? Burton's bits in English as the self-important Trotsky could have been interpolated later while everyone else could have acted in a language in which he could show a little expression. As it is, no one would ever guess that Delon and Schneider are major stars under different circumstances. Schneider seems to be here mostly so she can stand and/or lounge in lingerie, but even that appetizing opportunity goes underexploited since, as a self-respecting Trotskyite gal, she doesn't wear any make-up.<br /><br />There are several ""characters"" in this movie who in any normal film would have speaking parts, but since they never did settle the matter of what language they were shooting in, these people just stand there looking stupid and not saying anything. Unbelievably, we are expected to care when one of these ciphers gets killed (cue the cheap-looking mannequin) by Stalinists, or Fascists, or Anarcho-Syndicalists, or anti-Castro Cubans, or the CIA, or whatever. Nothing that goes on in this movie is ever very clear. And anyone expecting to learn a little something about the historical Trotsky will come away with the knowledge that he kept bunny rabbits at home.<br /><br />Delon plays Trotsky's assassin, Jackson, ""spelled without a k"". He's Belgian. When asked why a Belgian has a name like Jac(k)son, he explains that he's really French-Canadian. Oh, well, that's clear. Most of the movie operates on a ""duh"" level much like that.<br /><br />It is safe to conclude from the preceding that some mystery surrounded the precise identity of the assassin. If that is the case, the hapless direction of the utterly inept Joseph Losey was entirely confounded by a notion like ""mystery"". Or ""tension"". He manages to convey neither. The film has very little cutting, and hardly any reaction shots. There is no indication of what one is supposed to feel at any given moment. Everything looks like it was one take and wrap.<br /><br />Losey is fond of this absurd set-up where two people supposedly have a conversation with one in the extreme foreground and the other in the remote background. Natural sound wouldn't work so there's some badly dubbed dialogue on top. It's an attempt at an ""arty"" shot that Welles might have done something with, but which is completely botched in the hands of a hack like Losey.<br /><br />I can't conceive of anyone deriving any entertainment or elucidation from this fiasco. Five minutes spent with any reputable biography are more illuminating than 100 in the company of this film.",Performance,Directional Techniques,Others
"Nobody likes a bad movie, but sometimes you come across one that is so extremely bad it actually becomes enjoyable. This is the case with Camp Slaughter.<br /><br />Director Martin Munthe's idea of paying homage to his favorite slasher films (Friday the 13th) is by making one that is even worse. The so called effects were outdated even twenty years ago, and the story is a joke. However, you may not notice this since you are so busy laughing at the actors. Not only do they read their lines in the worst form of Swenglish, there's also an embarrassing lack of devotion and experience.<br /><br />You just have to watch this.",Visual Effect,Others,

There is no happy ending here, you can bet that, but at least you get a real story that is more appropriate to the times. That is worth much more to me than a smiling happy face, in the end.

Unlike anything else I've seen, this film showed the young mother's perspective and I could actually feel Jacey's pain as she didn't know whether she'd rather have her baby or keep her secret. I also think it showed the incredible sacrifices mothers will make; most other films and programmes about this subject show cold mothers who either kick their daughters out or resent them if they stay, which is not always the case. I would recommend this film to anyone and I hope to see Danielle Panabaker in something else soon as her acting is second-to-none.",Plot,Performance,
"I was really excited about the release of this movie as I think the Inkheart books are some of the best YA fiction around. The books are dark and suspenseful and filled with twists and surprises. The books are not funny or light hearted; children are killed, men die, women lament, and evil is very very threatening and scary. The characters likewise are complex (for YA literature) and provide much in the way complex behaviour. And you can't guess the ending unless you're really clever (which I, sadly, am not). I couldn't stop reading these books and finished them off in a week.<br /><br />OK, that's the books, what about the movie. Well the movie is light-hearted, the villains goofy, and the suspense completely lacking. The people I saw the movie with knew what kind of ending they were in for from the first 10 minutes of the movie. There was none of the fear and dread and darkness of the books. The movie was a lukewarm puffball, and the ratings on IMDb show that nobody was taken with the movie. 6.? is really bad for a movie here. And it's not surprising. What is there to be enthused about in the movie except for the cast and the locations, both of which are fantastic. The story is a limp noodle that offers no emotional involvement or suspense. It's just another kid's movie with no heart or faith in the audience.<br /><br />It should be noted that the first Inkheart book is by far the weakest in the trilogy and after I finished it I was on the fence as to whether I was going to finish the series. But I had bought the set and so I started book number 2. And that's when things get really good and inventive. So it's really disappointing that Inkworld and Inkdeath are never going to get a cinematic treatment, but at least we have the books. And really, after watching this movie, maybe it's a good thing because if they did the 'goofy lighthearted predictable' thing on books number 2 and 3, I would have been really disappointed.<br /><br />I would only recommend this movie to people that have read the series and are interested in seeing what Hollywood did with the source material. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking to get a memorable cinematic experience. I pretty much guarantee that most people will have forgotten this movie by the following morning, it is that inconsequential. <br /><br />So in summary, avoid the movie and if you liked the Harry Potter books, give the Inkheart books a whirl.",Others,Visual Effect,

How could all these potentially great elements be combined into one of the worst movies I've ever seen? It is forgivable to change the story, if the changes make for better filming, but in this movie the changes don't improve anything. The added material is pointless as well.

"I'm not sure what is worse  a bad film like the indie mess 'You and Me and Everyone We Know'  where you sit back and are in absolute agony and confusion; or a film like this one - where you are completely puzzled by how vapid and boring the proceedings are. Well, I do know which one I would vote for; still, I can't help but think how wasted the talents of Meryl Streep and Uma Thurman are in the absolutely dulling 'Prime'. And you could make a case I suppose, that for the money and star power wasted, maybe 'Prime' is more painful.<br /><br />The movie has little to recommend it. The lead actor  Bryan Greenberg  displays no charm or the personality necessary to indicate why a 'seasoned' woman like Uma Thurman would find him worthy of attention, let alone be compelled to rhapsodize on his penis. On the other side of the equation, Uma looks her age and then some, and why a 23 year old (with none of the maturity necessary to even appreciate an older woman) would be drawn to her is also baffling. Meryl Streep is invisible in a role for the first time that I can remember, and truly gives the appearance of phoning in her role.<br /><br />The film isn't terrifically bad  it's not an abysmal failure that will harm anyone's career. It's just a boring boring film, with pedestrian dialog, and perfunctory performances.

I guess you could watch this with your kids for harmless fun. But if your kids are old enough to remember the first two films in this franchise, they're too old to enjoy this one.<br /><br />Aside from showcasing the adverse effects of prolonged exposure to the sun, there was zero reason to drag out leather-skinned Paul Hogan for another installment of ""The Croc."" A silly plot, flat jokes, and some of the laziest acting this side of ""Con Air"" make this film entirely unnecessary.<br /><br />For humor, you're better off hitting an open-mic night.

"Some people do not 'get' this show and I'm not sure why. I always think that they haven't watched enough to get to know the characters or they can't quite relate to the abstract brilliance of it all. Well I'm not one of them for sure, as this show has provided me with more laughs than any other. From the disgusting habits of Lister to the delightful cheekiness of The Cat to the smug remarks from Rimmer the comic moments just go on and on. And yes, the Grant-Naylor partnership was possibly key in maintaining the subtlety of the gags. Yet, I do not necessarily agree that Series 7 and 8 were a pointless waste of time. For me, these two series were worth it just for Kryten alone. His eccentricity and corruption sort of 'blossomed' in a way and I felt Robert Llewlelyn took his character in the right direction. This is a point that will probably be hounded but you only need to see the psychiatrist scenes from the final series to see what I mean.<br /><br />Sadly, the other characters in the latter series seem to lose some of the magic they so brilliantly weaved in front of a live audience. However, the stories were still good enough to entice my viewing throughout all 8. My personal favourite series is series two. Even though this was when they were still (pretty much) confined to the Red Dwarf ship, the scripts and dialogues were absolutely fantastic. 'Thanks for the Memory' is so brilliantly constructed I think of it as the best half hour of comedy ever written. The way it begins with the drunken starbug flight back and ends with the discovery of what Lister has done with Rimmer's memory is pure genius. Then you have that brilliant moment where Danny John-Jules nails a one-liner so sublimely that you just have to cackle. Rimmer (played by the ace Chris Barrie) attempts a ridiculous explanation to how they've ended up with unusual predicaments after a late night party (for example broken legs) and tries to ease everyone's worries by suggesting it was alien communication. Then Cat (Danny John Jules) simply says ""I wouldn't want to be around when one of these suckers is making a speech"".<br /><br />Anyway, I could go on and on with the praise, so I'd just like to say to everyone involved in the show.............. thanks for the memories!!",Performance,Plot,
"Evidently this film was released overseas before it was seen locally. Bob Rafelson is an excellent screen writer who knows a lot about what is going on in the American cinema. As a director, he doesn't bring anything new to this Dashiell Hammett's short story adaptation. Perhaps he wasn't helped by the screen play of Christopher Canaan.<br /><br />The Hammett story was one of his best ones. The idea of the kind policeman, Jack Friar, trying to investigate something for a neighbor, brings him into a situation that will ensnare him, as he discovers the people in the house are planning a caper and take him prisoner.<br /><br />The acting is interesting in general. Samuel L. Jackson has to act tied to a chair throughout the movie. His scene with Erin, played with gusto by Milla Jovovich, brings a sensuality to the screen that adds another dimension to the story. Stellan Skargard makes a mean Tyrone. Doug Hutchison is intense as Hoop, Tyrone's partner in crime. Grace Zabriskie and Joss Ackland are seen as the Quarres, a couple that are involved in the robbery. Ms. Zabriskie, an excellent actress, has great moments as the older woman who presents a kind front, but is no good.

I don't believe that the country as we know it would come to an end as the film portrays, but it would suffer some very painful consequences. I thought that overall it was a very good movie. The director, Sergio Arau, is known for his interesting artistic take on his films. This one is really no different. The overflowing glass and leaky water faucet was nice symbolism as well. Although this film is a comedy, it does a nice job of bringing across its serious underlying message. Through some of the fluff and nonsensical points this movie in the end makes its point.

Or the atrociously bad acting. Or the barely existent plot.<br /><br />I think more than anything it's the sheer pointlessness of it all. Given how much time, money and energy it takes to make a feature-length film, you've got to ask: WHY? Why make a film like this? What on earth is the point? And 15 years after seeing it, I still have no answer to that.",Directional Techniques,Visual Effect,Others
"I know it didn't bring anything good to me. As a Christian I especially look for morality in a movie, anywhere I can find it, as long as there is some I might just enjoy the movie.<br /><br />But where the heck is the morality in this movie ? probably in the fact that one woman just wants to have her man back and the other one wants to look ""Forever Young"". It felt rather light to me, just as Hollywood often does, put a bit of morals in it and mix it with a lot of useless action, basic character building, ambiguous events and there you have it. This one barely makes the exception, it has Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn as leads and that's pretty much the reason I watched it to begin with.<br /><br />But then comes the 'women's fight for man' except here one woman is just looking for 'immortality' (as many have put it) and that is basically the only part in which it differs from other movies. True this one was made in 1992 so it may deserve some of the credit but nonetheless it isn't gripping at all.<br /><br />I stopped watching after hearing the Lord's name being spoken three times in vain, how much do you have to go through before you say 'enough is enough' ?<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie, even though Bruce Willis does good acting it does not save the movie, at all.

"Even though she was the first runner-up for the New York Film Critics Award, Faye Dunaway disavows her performance as screen icon Joan Crawford because the camp following this 1981 potboiler has developed over the years has probably been overwhelming. To put it mildly, she is certainly watchable. However, every line she utters seems to have an exclamation point, and every gesture feels so grandiose that it's hard to figure out just what empathetic qualities Crawford had to engender her long-standing popularity. The glibly titled 2006 Hollywood Royalty Edition DVD package makes no bones that this is a movie that now caters to its huge gay following. Dunaway's snub in participating (as well as director Frank Perry's death) means having flamboyant director John Waters pinch-hit on the commentary track, and he manages to be both funny and insightful as he shares lots of apocryphal gossip and zingy one-liners to bring a whole new flavor to the execrable film.<br /><br />Among his many errors in judgment, Perry decided to film the story of Crawford's mid-to-late years (or more appropriately, her adopted daughter Christina's version of it) as if the movie was one of Crawford's own overripe films. The problem with his serious-minded approach is that it veers so unpredictably back and forth between soap opera and pure camp that the only consistency is its artifice. The story begins as the movie star's career is in free fall at MGM in 1939 (when she was forced to film a true atrocity called ""Ice Follies of 1939""). Aware of her professional dilemma, Crawford decides to adopt a baby regardless of being a twice-divorced single career woman. With the help of her studio lackey lover Greg Savitt, she adopts a daughter and later a son. Forever the publicity hound, Crawford presents her happy family in the most pretentious manner in front of the Hollywood press, yet hides a streak of cruelty that manifests itself into military-like parenting and savagely violent episodes. Not living up to her mother's exacting standards, Christina is shuttled off to boarding school and then convent school. She grows up to become a struggling young TV actress, as her mother becomes a corporate wife-turned widow slipping deeper into alcoholism.<br /><br />Perry makes a fundamental mistake in switching the film's narrative perspective from Joan to Christina midway through the film. The consequence is that neither of their stories is fully told with any objectivity, especially what could have happened in Crawford's earlier years that would have led to such excessive behavior. Instead, we are given an endless parade of over-the-top moments  the tree chopping, the tile scrubbing, the wire hangers, the out-of-control strangulation - that the movie is simply too exhausting to keep up with the episodic storyline. With her reasonable resemblance to the movie star in full make-up, Dunaway carries herself confidently within the Crawford public persona and even achieves some remote moments of poignancy in between the shouting matches. Her strenuous efforts at verisimilitude, however, push her into an unsavory, demonic level of commitment to the larger-than-life role. It's too bad that almost everyone else is quite awful by comparison  Diana Scarwid frustratingly wooden as the adult Christina, Rutanya Alda irritatingly earnest in her blind devotion as Crawford's confidante Carol Ann, Steve Forrest looking like aged beef as Savitt and Howard Da Silva merely smarmy as MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer. The one exception is little Mara Hobel, who brings genuine cunning to the younger Christina.<br /><br />The Hollywood Royalty Edition includes three dishy featurettes. The 14-minute ""The Revival of Joan Crawford"" shows the genesis of the movie from Christina's red-hot best seller with contributions from Scarwid, Alda and producer Frank Yablans, who speaks candidly about Dunaway's tempestuous perfectionism. The 14-minute ""Life With Joan"" focuses on Dunaway's total absorption in the part during the stormy production and includes an extended opening sequence that was deleted before release. The 16-minute ""Joan Lives On"" speaks specifically to the film's cult status with Waters and Crawford impersonator Lypsinka providing particularly comic insight to its gay following. There is also a photo gallery and the original trailer. It's truly for lovers of cinema camp.",Performance,Plot,Directional Techniques
".. there must be a movie out there that's even worse. Lame characters even lamer acting. Lots of voice actors even the great David Ogden ""Cogsworth"" Stiers himself couldn't turn this movie into something decent. I haven't seen any acting of the man but he is by far a wonderful voice actor. Then there's John Kassir who did Meeko in Pocahontas. Not much of a speaking role. Anyway back to Justice League... really bad costumes, like the 60's Batman series which was good for it's time. And weak SFX this movie isn't worth my time.

"Somehow I always thought this was Bertolucci's first film. It isn't. But it looks like it. Here's a director with a huge potential, a cinematographer who'll soon be one of the greatest, but they still have a long way to go. We were young and Bertolucci was very left-wing so it was de rigueur to find this great, but in fact it was boring. The plot meanders on, the acting is wooden, and in the end you don't know if there was a story there at all. Bertolucci has become an icon, maybe more because of the scandals adhering to his films than of the intrinsic worth of his cinematographic output (in contrast to for instance Ettore Scola). No scandalous scenes in this one though, just plain pretension and showing off.",Directional Techniques,Others,
"Lame script, bad directing. The school scenes were so unrealistic -- c'mon, on her very first day at school a black girl completely befriends her out of nowhere and treats her like she's her best friend, even sticking up for her to every other girl in school. Couldn't they at least have set it up better, where Sarah does something to gain her trust, or her friend has a white parent, or anything interesting? Something besides no reason or charity work.<br /><br />The scenes where they practiced dancing in the empty school room, they were so stupid it was embarrassing to watch. And practicing how to sit? She's white, not a guy. The club dancing scenes, also ridiculous and hard to watch. Show me someone in the room making a comment or something. Wasn't the point of this movie to make a statement about racial tension and acceptance? She hardly had any real problems that weren't easily avoided. Even the eventual ""fight"" with her boyfriend lasted only 2 minutes and was reconciled for no particular reason.<br /><br />And too often I always notice Stiles acting, if you know what I mean, which isn't a good thing. Like in a high school play.<br /><br />The scene in the ER waiting room with her friend going off on her, that was about the only good dramatic scene. And even that was a cliché quote (""black girls don't have enough good black men anymore"") that I've heard many times before on TV and movies.<br /><br />Sarah's constant ""I don't want to talk about it"" about her boycotting dancing and about her mother...cliché like a bad sitcom. Ooh, but then she overcomes it all in the end, with the help of her boyfriend...how surprising.<br /><br />This was really painful to watch. I gave it a 2 because I've seen a lot worse movies. The script and filming must have been put together really quickly because it seemed like there wasn't much imagination behind it. I actually thought going into it that there would be some interesting viewpoints or more hard-hitting scenes. I guess I forgot it was an MTV movie.",Plot,,

Yet an overall goofiness survives throughout. <br /><br />Maybe it was the complete lack of humor (This is straightforward Poe style moralizing), the video quality that reminded me of a Canadian television movie, or the fact that after watching companion feature Devil's Experiment anything looks good but this little film wasn't all that bad.",Plot,Visual Effect,Others
"Telling about the years from his fateful first encounter with the Castro brothers in Mexico to the end of the revolution, The Argentine helps show how a young doctor became a Comandante respected and loved by a nation that was not even his. This was a man with ideals, one who believed in the love of humanity, justice, and truth. He was a doctor above all else, patching up the troops and making sure the people in every village they passed through had the care and attention they needed. He also was not afraid to lead the charge and stand at the frontlines without fear of death. One must live as though they have already died, then the fear will be gone and you can do what is necessary for the cause. It is about the group and the country, not about his survival. In his idealized communist beliefs he was fighting for Cuba and the only outcomes allowed were victory or his own destruction.<br /><br />Soderbergh's ambitions are evident right from the start. Although it mainly concerns the years between 1955-1962, he splices in events happening later on as Che visits the UN. Shot in black and white to help juxtapose against the sumptuous colors of our main action, these future scenes comment on what is happening during the war, cutting in to enhance the tale. There is a lot of structural jumping between the years, each change titled with a date and place to orient us as the viewers. The technique lends a more modern artistic scope to what would otherwise be a linear narrative and I believe helps tell the story more coherently. He has edited the film for the most efficient portrayal of the facts, a somewhat cause and effect relationship to better let us understand the situation. And it is a beautifully shot film, lending a fly on the wall type feel as we follow the revolutionaries or watch the UN debate. It is less artifice than an account of what happened based on the memoirs of Guevara himself. All the battles and all the victories from start to finish, his own uphill advancement through the ranks, from doctor to right-hand man, instructor of new recruits to leader of an army. However, if this film is to be believed, Che never wanted the power past being able to get the job done. Once Cuba was free he wanted to bring the revolution to all of Latin America, to share his experiences and political viewpoints. An intelligent man, he is shown fighting for his beliefs, no matter the cost. Unafraid to do what was needed meant he was unafraid to kill. Does a man like that deserve to be glorified in a film like this? That is in the eye of the beholder because to some he was a hero and a patriot, but like every conflict in history, where there is a good side there is a bad. To view a battle objectively is impossible because there will always be someone to defend it and someone else to protest.<br /><br />The Argentine is one that will make you think about the strength of the mind and the power of ideas. A country came together and helped back a revolt with force to take over the government. With the charismatic and understated performance from Benicio Del Toro as Che, one can't help but see why. Always with a smile and a kind word, he ruled with respect and without compromising his beliefs. The fact that he leads intellectually makes the moments of outburst that much more effective. The role should garner a lot of praise as he embodies the man completely, shedding any preconceptions of the actor himself. Demotions and promotions don't apply during his tenure in the army, he does what Castro needs him to do; he follows his leader and expects the same from those under him. He portrays this man as one to be listened to and taken seriously. Castro himself holds council and values his ideas, and one might say that if Fidel was the face of the revolt, the man pulling the strings, Che was the muscle, the force allowing it all to happen.<br /><br />In the end, though, while the visuals are gorgeous and the acting superb, it is the story that leaves a little something to be desired. Structurally interesting and easier to follow than one might think due to the jumps in time, we are not shown all the details. Often times we are thrown directly into the action without knowledge of why we are there or what is happening for what reason. Events occur and we are shown flashes, learning details after the fact or never at all. An example is when Che all of a sudden needs a cast for his arm. We don't know what happened, another character actually asks him, but when the answer is about to be said, we cut to another scene. Soderbergh seems to have crafted the tale he wanted to, only allowing us to see what he deems important, while leaving all other details by the wayside. He paints Guevara in a kind light, as a warrior with a purpose, never putting himself in front of the mission or country. In that regard the film is about the Argentine, but on the whole it is really about the war itself. Why is Batista bad? Why is Castro good? None of that matters. This isn't a history lesson showing the reasoning or rationale, you can get that in a book. Instead Soderbergh is just sharing the events themselvesas they happen, not why. You can't deny the scale or ambitions on display, however, the lack of background may make it hard to decipher, or even hard to really care.",Performance,Visual Effect,

"From the very first frames 3 Deewarein grips you and won't let go. This very well may be the best movie of its kind I have ever seen an *any* language. In fact, apart from the subtitles, you might just forget that you're watching an Indian film. Even the normal liberties that Bollywood normally takes with the concept of ""suspension of disbelief"" (and that Bolly fans have come to accept) are mostly absent from this movie. The characters are deep, intense and best of all completely credible. Others here have hailed 3 Deewarein as Juhi Chawla's comeback film, and she certainly shines in her role. But perhaps more surprising to me was Jackie Shroff's performance. Shroff's typical roles haven't impressed me one way or the other -- as especially good or bad -- in most other movies I've seen him in. But his portrayal of ""Jaggu"" here definitely made me sit up and take notice. And left me wondering how much of my former indifference was due to Jackie, and how much was due to the scripts he's been working from. Nasserudin Shah presents another complex and lovable character in ""Ishaan"". While not quite as endearing as the title role in ""Shree 420"", ""Ishaan"" certainly shares some qualities with that character.<br /><br />The story might be best compared to a pointillist painting. In the beginning we see very narrow views from very close angles. It's only as the plot unfolds and we back away from the canvas that we see the actual picture. And the canvas itself is impressive and elegantly understated. The opening sequences -- shot in blue-toned monochrome -- introduce the story in very short order (the entire run time of the film is listed at 120 minutes, which by Bollywood standards almost qualifies as a ""short subject"") and there is nothing wasted during the exposition. And it's because of this that you are drawn in immediately and rooted for the duration.<br /><br />I cannot bring myself to write anything that would hint at the ending of the story. To do that here would be to do you and the film a grave injustice. Let it suffice to say that the ending was not even *remotely * what I expected.<br /><br />If you're only a fan of ""Masti-Masala"" fare, don't watch this movie. You will be disappointed. But if you can spare two hours to be engrossed by a story that is at times grim, and times heartwarming and most of all surprising you *need* to see this film.

"How wonderful, how divine, how engrossing..........it's the Grand Hotel where ""nothing ever happens"", according to Lewis Stone's character. This is one of those films that must be watched repeatedly to savor the glamour and nuances of the performances of the star-studded cast. Let's talk about the cast. GARBO: Many think she went over-the-top with her performance of the ballerina who doubts her own talent and star power. Instead I find it exactly right. She is playing an artist given to flights of fancy and eccentricity (she'd be called a diva today). Watch her as she plays her scenes with John Barrymore......she is besotted with him after their night together. It's perfect JOHN BARRYMORE: The troubled star gives it his all as the suave, desperate but basically decent Baron. He hits just the right note in his performance and it was to be his next to last great performance. JOAN CRAWFORD: ""WOW"" might be the word for her playing of the slightly dishonorable stenographer. I think this may be one of her greatest roles before she went on the likes of ""Mildred Pierce"" and her other roles of suffering women. LIONEL BARRYMORE: His character (but not his acting) is the one I like least because he is constantly cringing and apologizing; however,based on the type of role it is, he is right on the money. His scenes with his brother are extremely well done. WALLACE BEERY: Nobody could have done the blustering, egocentric magnate better than Beery. He spent a lot of his career in more comedic roles and here he shows that he can actually act.<br /><br />Lewia Stone, as the disfigured doctor who is always waiting for a message (what kind of message is never made clear) is good in support as is Jean Hersholt, the head porter.<br /><br />Yes, it's dated, maybe some of the dialogue is considered corny, and the performances are of the time..........and it is magnificent.

It is also worth noting that David Cronenberg's above-mentioned ""Scanners"" seem to owe a great deal to this movie.<br /><br />""The Fury"" balances brilliantly between weird and unexpected comedy (like the whole scene where Douglas carjacks two off-duty cops, one played by Dennis Franz!) and imaginative horror that will turn off anyone who hates blood. Great acting from everyone; worth noting the star-making performances of Amy Irving and Andrew Stevens, Douglas who has a field-day, Cassavetes who looks great as the sinister bad-guy and Carrie Snodgress who will touch your heart with her performance as the caring nurse Hester.<br /><br />The last scene is quite a kick, truly one of the most memorable finales ever shown on screen, and it could very well leave you cheering well into the end credits!",Performance,Visual Effect,
"Wow! Noribuki Obayashi's ""Hausu"" aka. ""House"" of 1977 is easily one of the weirdest films I ever saw and I generally generally am a fan of the bizarre. A Horror-fan and avid lover of Japanese cinema, especially from the 70s, I had high expectations for this film, and I was not disappointed, even though the film was totally different than what I had expected. Having read no reviews of the film before seeing it, I expected a pure Horror film, but it turned out to be an incomparably bizarre and experimental Horror-parody, with a delightfully macabre and grotesque humor rather than scares. The film already starts out extremely strange (in an awesome manner), and it gradually gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.<br /><br />The film starts off with a bunch of teenage high-school girls, all of whom have certain distinctive characteristics that are mentioned in their nicknames, who travel to the countryside to visit the aunt of one of the girls. I don't want to spoil even a tiny bit of the plot of this unique Horror-parody, and therefore won't carry with a plot description, but I can assure that fans of surrealism and weird cinema will be delighted. While ""Hausu"" is not a film I would recommend to everyone, this is an absolute must-see to all my fellow fans of Japanese film, the Horror-genre and bizarre art-house cinema. Director Obayashi uses a bizarre of editing imaginable, with grotesque cutting, totally insane effects. Sometimes the editing equals that of a (bizarre) video-clip, only to jump to an entirely different style. Yet all this strangeness never draws the viewer away from the story, which is itself just as surreal as the film's style. Overall ""Hausu"" can be described as a unique and bizarre fairy tale with a grotesque and ingenious, often macabre and always unique sense of humor. There are moments in this film at which the viewer will just stare at the screen not knowing what to think, and scenes at which one is barely able to breathe in laughter, and every second of the film is very strange. Very delightfully strange that is, as ""Hausu"" is a bizarre gem that must not be missed by lovers of the surreal. Mainstream audiences might not know what to think of this, but every fan of a more unique form of cinema should give this a try. Surreal, exceptional, and one of a kind!",Performance,Visual Effect,Directional Techniques
"A lengthy biopic about Wyatt Earp, this splendid film tackles the problem of telling the story of an actual man's life, and does it well.<br /><br />People do not live like Hollywood films in that our lives have no plot. Wyatt Earp does have a plot, but it is not the glamorous rocket ride of an action film. We get to see Wyatt Earp not so much as a hero, but as a man. He had virtues. But he had flaws and shortcomings, and they led to pain for himself and others.<br /><br />Earp's life was not limited to his time in Tombstone and the movie reflects that. He was around for quite some time before and after that famous gunfight at the OK Corrall. The makers of this movie appreciate that. And though today we associate him most strongly with that event, it did not define him. Rather, he helped to define it. And his life kept right on trucking after that.<br /><br />Good performances all around, although I did not believe anyone gave the performance of their career.<br /><br />Often this movie is compared to another film, Tombstone. But Wyatt Earp is aptly titled, because it is not only about Tombstone. It covers decades and brings a sweeping sense of time to the picture. It is also quite lovely. Shot with a sense of honesty, sometimes the characters appear quite unfashionable. They appear real, nonetheless, and don't look like they just stepped out of a Vidal Sasson commercial.<br /><br />Overall, a good biography about a man of the times.",Directional Techniques,Others,
"As I heard, what´s the theme of ""Common Ground"", I thought first about other attempts like ""In & Out"", ""Jeffrey"" (also with Steven Weber) or ""The Birdcage"". Only another comedy ? No, this movie is completely different!<br /><br />It shows the problems of this group of outsiders in a very strong and serious way. Through the different decades, ""Common Ground"" takes the time for different persons and times and tries to give an complete answer and evaluation. But this separation has in my opinion not only good sites. You can see the development in the treatment of homosexuality. But the time (around 30 minutes) is to short for the different episodes. So, it does not reach the ground of the problem. Many aspects are also named twice, especially in the first two episodes. And the message in episode three (All is better now. )is not believable for me and too trivial.<br /><br />Despite of this, for me it is an must-see movie with great performances of the actors (especially Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a swimmer in part 2 !), an intelligent dramaturgy and an unconventional ending.",Performance,Plot,
"Non Ho Sonno, or Sleepless as it's commonly known to English speaking audiences, starts in 'Turin, 1983' where a young boy named Giacomo (Daniele Angius) has just witnessed his mother (Francesca Vettori) being brutally murdered by an unseen assailant, Chief Inspector Ulisse Moretti (Max von Sydow) promises Giacomo that he will find his mother's killer even if it takes him the rest of his life. It's now' Turin, Today' & a prostitute named Angela (Barbara Lerici) refuses to comply with her clients disgusting demands & in her hurry to leave their apartment knocks over a table out of which falls some large dangerous looking knives & a blue folder which she accidentally puts into her bag in her rush. On the train home Angela looks inside the folder & finds evidence that her client is a murder & somehow connected to the 'dwarf murders' back in '83. Angela phones her friend Amanda (Conchita Puglisi) to pick her up at the train station but Angela is brutally murdered before the train arrives, outside the station Amanda is also murdered. The current Chief Inspector, Manni (Paolo Maria Scalondro) is on the case, he talks with the now retired Moretti about the dwarf murders but finds out little except that the man thought responsible Vincenzo De Fabritiis (Luca Faglioli) committed suicide. A dancer at the 'Zoo' club named Mel (Elena Marchesini) is the next to be murdered. Giacomo (Stefano Dionisi) now lives in Rome but receives a phone call from an old friend named Lorenzo (Roberto Zibetti) who tells him that the dwarf murders may have started again. With the possibility of his mother's killer striking again Giacomo travels back to Turin where he teams up with Moretti & a friend named Gloria (Chiara Caselli) to try & solve the dwarf murders once & for all...<br /><br />This Italian production was co-written, produced & directed by Dario Argento I must admit in my humble opinion this is his worst film to date that I've seen. Many hailed it as a return to form, well I'm not having any of that as this can't compare to Argento's best. The script by Argento & Franco Ferrini while Carlo Lucarelli has a 'collaboration' credit has all the classic Argento ingredients like the black gloved killer, the ultra shiny selection of knives & blades, a ridiculous plot & a few glimpses of his unique style. Unfortunately Non Ho Sonno came in a lull in Argento's career coming after his widely panned Phantom of the Opera (1998) remake. Non Ho Sonno feels like a commercial attempt at making a film that utilises what Argento is best known for but at the same time he was under pressure to make it a success, while this is undeniably a Giallo I felt that it tried to incorporate elements from American teen horror that was proving very successful at the time like Scream (1996), I know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Urban Legend (1998), Final Destination (2000) & their various sequels & imitators. The largely teenage cast that populate the film, would Tenebre (1982) been as good if it featured a cast of teens? The hip locations including a rave & local pub where one of the teens even drinks non alcoholic drink. The good looking teen hero & his girlfriend who becomes the damsel in distress & who both manage to solve the murders even though the combined efforts of the Italian police can't & check out the 'crowd pleasing' comedy scene with the dwarfs in the police station. The eventual & obligatory twist ending is flat & had little impact as far as I was concerned. Non Ho Sonno is far too slow at almost 2 hours, there are few murders & none really stay in the memory. There are brief glimpses of Argento's class, the nicely lit blue tones as Mel is killed, or the sequence when Argento's camera pans across the floor for what seems like an eternity with lots of people walking past to come to rest on the killers & their victims feet by which a few seconds later her decapitated head lands but these scenes are few & far between as although technically Non Ho Sonno is good it's all pretty bland & forgettable for most of it's duration. I even found the gore disappointing, a few cut off fingers, a graphic bullet through someones head, someone being gorily killed with an English horn, a decapitation, a pen stuck in someones temple, someone has their face bashed in & a few quick stabbings. It all sounds better than it actually is, it's very spread out & isn't particularly graphic. There is some brief full frontal nudity but nothing to get too excited about. The acting is OK but the dubbing doesn't help, Max von Sydow adds a touch of elegance & class Non Ho Sonno definitely doesn't deserve. Overall a very disappointing effort from Argento, there is very little I can recommend in this film. Watch Tenebre, The Stendahl Syndrome (1996), Opera (1987), Suspiria (1977) or Deep Red (1975) again instead & remember the good times which don't look like they'll return anytime soon...",Plot,Visual Effect,Music
"I watched this movie yesterday and after it was over I couldn't believe I wasted any of my time watching it! I rarely think that there are no redeeming qualities to a movie, but this one just had none. There seemed to be NO REASON for it to have even been made. I like most of the actors in it, but this was a complete waste of film. I know this sounds harsh, and I didn't hate it, it just seemed like it didn't need to have been made. The characters were pathetic and seemed to have no clear reasons for what they did. The only scene I thought was halfway effective or interesting was when they were all in the car and Dobbs was driving and Claudia was forced to talk about her sexual past and her relationship w/ Dobbs.

However someone else much more unwelcome decides to gatecrash the party, a brutal killer is at large & intends to slaughter them all before the night is over...<br /><br />Directed by Sally Mattison (at least we now know a woman can make a horror film just as badly as any bloke) I thought Slumber Party Massacre III (although the version I watched had the title A Stab in the Dark) was a dull, predictable, unoriginal teen slasher that does nothing to try & distinguish itself in an already over populated & limited sub-genre. The script by Catherine Cyran is drawn out, it has the usual cardboard character's that could have come straight out of any other slasher film, it has no reasonable explanation behind the killers motives, it gives the killer identity away far too early & then it's just a boring precession until the end & to add insult to injury it has a fairly low body count. There is nothing in Slumber Party Massacre III that any horror fan wouldn't have already seen a 100 time before in just about any other slasher. The film takes itself far too seriously, it's incredibly dull & very slow at times.<br /><br />Director Mattison doesn't do a thing to try & liven things up, it's very flatly shot, it's utterly forgettable & throughly dull. There's no atmosphere & I just kept thinking to myself simply leave the house, run away, go to a neighbour's, call someone but just do SOMETHING instead of just standing there waiting to be killed. There's a decent kill at the start where someone has a drill shoved through their body but apart from that there's not much gore here, there's a few more drill murders, someone is impaled on a 'For Sale' house sign & in the films best kill someone is taking a bath & the killer drops a vibrating dildo in the water to electrocute her, death by dildo! There's a bit of nudity & sex as well but it doesn't really help that much.<br /><br />Slumber Party Massacre III is fairly well made, special effects are OK & it's quite well lit but it's all rather bland. The acting was poor throughout, don't give up your day jobs girls...<br /><br />Slumber Party Massacre III is nothing to get excited about, frankly I was pretty bored & felt liked I'd seen it all before. Much worse than either the original The Slumber Party Massacre (1982) or it's sequel the rather impressive & fun Slumber Party Massacre II (1987) so watch one of those instead.",Plot,Visual Effect,Directional Techniques
"I liked some parts of this film mostly because of its Chicago location shots, But I thought the film's production values were very low budget for a Hollywood film. It really looks reminiscent of a made-for-TV movie. The overlaid 80's Casio keyboard soundtrack for example, made this film seem (well what it is) very very 80's cheese. Watching it i couldn't help think immediately of ""About Last Night"" a GREAT film! How can two films both shot in Chicago, the same year (1986), and both films a Tri-Star production look so completely different!?! In a nutshell my favorite actor in this film was Eva Marie Saint who indeed gave a saint of a performance - The scene of her talking to her husband (Gleason) in the hospital, spilling her guts ""What Happened to us Max? I cared, I know I cared"" and Max's reply was a self-centered cold, ""Bullshit"". God I felt her pain. It ripped my heart out. Don't rent this film but if it comes on TV on a Sunday afternoon you may get thru it but then go out immediately and rent ""About Last Night"" to cheer you up. This one is a BIG DOWNER.",Music,Performance,
"Melodramatic, yes, but this movie has some meat to it that I wasn't expecting. Clark Gable and William Powell play childhood friends who grow up to be a hood and a respected judge, respectively. Both have a thing for Myrna Loy, but the expected rivalry for which this plot would seem to be tailor made never comes. Instead, there's a refreshingly serious story about the boundaries of loyalty and friendship. When Gable is accused of murder and sentenced to the death penalty, it is Powell's duty to decide whether or not to let his personal feelings for Gable interfere with his practice of legal justice. Loy pops up throughout, but, unfortunately, she's window dressing. (Side note: My wife and I decided to have a Myrna Loy theme to our New Year's movie night, and rented this and ""The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer."" We couldn't have picked two Myrna Loy movies that do a worse job of showing off Myrna Loy). No, this movie belongs to the men, and the whole affair is better than I expected it to be.<br /><br />Grade: B+",Plot,Others,
"I admit that some notorious criminals may hold a certain fascination to viewers of reality shows. I am even sufficiently endowed with a huge circle of friends of many 'preferences in entertainment' to grant you that even minor criminals (still murderous but less stylish, say) can grab your attention for a few episodes. I am far more dubious about people whose only claim to notoriety is being the wife / daughter / grandson of some petty hit-man. It's not their ignorance, cursing, rudeness or immense self-indulgence that puts me off. I can endure that if the people in question display ANY kind of talent, interesting quirkiness or even clinical schizophrenia. I cannot endure it for more than the 15 minutes I was exposed to by a not-all-that-well-meaning friend when it's a case of ""Watch us! See how brainless AND rich we are. Look how it's possible to live on Blood Money and no talent whatsoever in modern America"". It is idiotic but not in a funny way. And creepy but in a way that diminishes the humanity of the God knows how many victims these people founded their money, vulgarity and tastelessness upon.

That is only the South, so kudos for getting Naples right and Tuscany wrong. And general shame on you as to the cable A&E or ""Bio."" channel I saw this on. You used to be better.

The plots were always watchable and interesting, with occasional but excellent humor, and the acting was first rate. Darren McGavin was dashing as the captain (think Kolchak minus fifteen years).<br /><br />Darren McGavin was the star of this series.

"We know Bogart liked to keep working. The movies he made in the late Forties through the mid Fifties, however, sometimes give ""work"" a bad name. He veered effortlessly between fine movies that to this day continue to challenge, satisfy or do both and movies that are nothing more than nearly forgotten commercial hackwork. He knew what he was turning out; he called Sirocco a stinker. What an odd and undiscriminating selection process he and his agent must have had. In 1950 he makes Chain Lightening but then makes In a Lonely Place. In 1951 it's Sirocco and then The African Queen. In 1953 it's Battle Circle and then Beat the Devil (maybe a confusing failure, but not hackwork). <br /><br />With Sirocco Bogart gives us Harry Smith, a gunrunner who finds himself in Damascus. The year is 1925. The French run things. A lot of Syrians don't like that at all. They're called ""rebels."" Harry? He doesn't care one way or another as long as he's paid. Harry is tired, sour, cynical and a skeptic. He doesn't believe in anything except money and the value of his own hide. He's Bogart. Harry quickly finds himself involved with a martinet of a French general named LaSalle (Everett Sloane) who thinks shooting five Syrians for every dead French soldier will be educational for everyone; a sympathetic French colonel named Feroud (Lee J. Cobb) who thinks he can avoid bloodshed if he can just sit down and talk things over with the rebel leaders, especially Emir Hassan (Onslow Stevens); and Feroud's mistress, a cool drink of water named Violette (Marta Toren), a beautiful woman who seems to be aroused more by the prospect of shopping than the prospect of making love. In other words, a courtesan to scriptwriters, a sophisticated prostitute to the more realistic; something akin to a wealthy CEO's trophy wife. Harry meets Violette, wants her and comes close to falling for her. This sets up some tension between himself and Colonel Feroud. All the while Harry is trying to extricate himself from an arms deal gone very, very wrong. By the end of the movie no one has gained much of anything, although it appears Violette will have the time to do more shopping. <br /><br />At one point in Sirocco Violette says to Harry Smith, ""What a man! You're so ugly! Yes, you are! How can a man so ugly be so handsome?"" Ugly? Quasimodo, that's ugly. Bogart may not have been handsome, but he had style, a unique screen personality and the good fortune to star in three -- count 'em, three -- iconic career-making movies in less than two years. High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca carved Bogart's screen persona so deeply in granite that even hackwork like Sirocco scarcely makes a chip. When we see Harry we're really seeing Roy, Sam and Rick. <br /><br />There's no reason to watch this movie unless you're fond of Bogart and have an hour and a half to waste. But if you watch, remember Everett Sloane. He was a fine, fine actor who seldom found memorable parts in Hollywood. He was a member of Orson Welles' Mercury Theater and came to Hollywood with Welles. He wound up in the Fifties doing a ton of television shows. He killed himself in 1965 when he was 55. My best memories of Sloane include Mr. Bernstein in Citizen Kane (1941); Arthur Bannister in The Lady from Shanghai (1947); Mario Belli in Prince of Foxes (1949); Dr. Eugene Brock in The Men (1950); and, powerfully, Walter Ramsey in Patterns (1956).",Directional Techniques,Plot,Others
"sorry but this film is one of the worst i'v seen in European cinema. alright, it has all the clichés and canons of European civilisation, but simply plucking these cultural allusions from everywhere doesn't show any intelligence. moreover, these citations are the most stereotypical, the explanations (of the ruins, legends, etc) the most simplicist, repeating parrot-like the information one can usu find in primary-school text books. the multilingual conversation is amazingly superficial, setting up all these binaries of man-woman, east-west, love-hate. frankly this degree of intellect can be simply found in any street. the ending is quite atrociously suspect to racism, and certainly very stupidly eurocentric. probably the worst thing of the film is that it pretends to make some profound comments whilst it is at best a slap-stick piece of nonsense with a jerk in the last scene",Others,,
"I have a feeling that many of us have entertained the whimsical notion, as we dragged ourselves to work in the morning, that it might be nice to have hot coffee fed intravenously into our systems. Well, in the misleadingly titled Boris Karloff vehicle ""The Man With Nine Lives"" (1940), we get to see that such a procedure might be as pleasant as imagined. In this picture, experimental patients of one Dr. Mason, who's looking to cure cancer victims via cryogenics, are brought out of deep freeze in just that manner! Dr. Mason and his nurse fiancée soon discover the body of cryogenics pioneer Dr. Leon Kravaal, 100 feet underground in a Canadian ice cave, where he'd been laying frozen--a corpsicle--for a full decade. Dr. Kravaal (played by Karloff, of course, in still another of his overly ardent scientist roles) is remarkably brought back to life, and begins his scientific pursuits anew. Anyway, this film is a fairly restrained affair, impeccably acted by its small cast, economically written, nicely photographed, and captured here on a pristine-looking DVD. The goateed Kravaal, likable at first, grows increasingly deranged as the film progresses, but still manages to hold the audience's sympathies; a brilliant scientist using unethical methods to achieve great ends. Despite the far-fetched central conceit of the possibility of freezing a man indefinitely and bringing him back to life, the movie is fairly believable; a testament to its intelligent script and fine players. But wait...did I say ""far-fetched""? I have a feeling that Walt Disney, Ted Williams and thousands of frozen sperm cells the world over might disagree with that sentiment!",Plot,Performance,Directional Techniques
"I was transfixed by this show since my first viewing. One man in the wild for seven days - no camera crew, nothing but a multi-tool and some basic equipment. The show is set up to more or less mimic a typical survival situation - lost at sea, lost while hiking, a plane crash in the wilderness, etc. It adds an extra element of credibility and realism.<br /><br />The host then proceeds to do what he must to survive with what he has available, and to make use of or anticipate a use for what he is left with, be it a damaged bicycle, plane, parachute, backpack, etc. Les is alone in this, performing everything including all of his own camera work. So when we see him walking off into the distance or climbing down a bluff, he has to walk or climb all the way back to his camera to retrieve it.<br /><br />The wilderness settings are incredibly varied, from the arctic to the jungles, tropical islands to open ocean. We get a taste of just about every possible terrain as well, from mountains to desert plains.<br /><br />The thing I like the most about the show is its practicality. Les doesn't take unnecessary risks for the sake of entertainment. He cooks his food whenever he can, doesn't attempt unrealistic tasks that would set him up for injury, and otherwise attempts to conserve his energy as much as possible. He also stresses the psychological aspects of survival, focusing on keeping his spirits up to avoid the depression and lonely solitude of his situation.<br /><br />I don't have much criticism for the show. Les plans to be rescued in seven days, and it is often easy to see this anticipation in his routine. In a way this reduces the tension, since we know he will be saved at a predetermined time. But then again if someone isn't rescued from being lost in a few days, then their chance of survival diminishes dramatically. It is not realistic to eschew certain safety considerations and prolong one's suffering merely because I think it might make for a more unpredictable show. <br /><br />So then my complaints really are minor and perhaps frivolous, since this remains among my favorite shows on TV. Practical, interesting, often exciting, and filled with useful survival information, this show is great and deserves the success it enjoys. Enjoy with my recommendations.",Plot,Others,

"Chris O'Donnell plays a young handsome man who is (sigh) afraid of getting married. But he's been dating Renee Zellweger for three years and she wants to get married. He tries to propose but fails. Then his obnoxious grandfather dies and leaves him 100 million dollars...IF he gets married before his 30th birthday. But his 30th birthday is one day away, Zellweger has left town and he frantically races around town asking all the women he's dated in the past to marry him.<br /><br />O'Donnell doing comedy was a BAD mistake. For starters he can't act. Also this guy is handsome but he's so bland it's annoying. Doing a remake of Buster Keaton's hilarious classic ""Seven Chances"" was another stupid mistake. The script is unfunny and full of lines that are just groaners. Old pros Hal Holbrook, Edward Asner and James Cromwell are in this and manage to get a few chuckles despite their lines. The view of women is this film (especially at the end) is deplorable and there's a HUGE amount of swearing for a PG-13 film. Still it DOES have its good points (that's why I'm giving it a 4). O'Donnell's first proposal to Zellweger (and her reaction) is very funny. There's a good cast (save O'Donnell) and Zellweger is just great. There's also a cool soundtrack. Also Brooke Shields (almost unrecognizable) is hysterical in a segment towards the end. But, all in all, this was a REAL unwise career choice for O'Donnell. This movie bombed badly and got O'Donnell some of the worst reviews of his career. Hopefully this will steer him clear of ever trying comedy again. I give this a 4.",Plot,Performance,
"This is really one of the most boring and useless movies I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. Generally speaking, I enjoy it when film makers expose a fringe subculture that is basically unknown to the general viewing audience. However, in the case of this klunky flick, that subculture is so intensely boring, so contrived, so unbearably drab and elitist that the film becomes almost unwatchable. Unless you are completely turned on by androgynous and asexual, white, thirty-something maritimers who wear vintage clothing, ride refurbished bicycles, and who enjoy long directionless conversations in a stilted and emotionless vernacular, than this is not the movie for you. Nothing about this movie seemed real or important, and I found it impossible to relate to anyone or anything within it.<br /><br /> To sum it up, Parsley Days made me feel like I was lying in a patch of dirt, in a stranger's backyard, wrapped in a cold, wet, musty smelling towel, while eating a bowl of plain white tofu, and listening to Ani DiFranco.<br /><br /> Avoid this movie.",Plot,Others,

"I Like To Play Games Too is another offering from the Eros label, part of the Playboy empire.

"I had never even heard of this film before Mondo Macabro announced their upcoming DVD release of it, so I was surprised to find - after I had already ordered it online - that Leonard Maltin had in fact reviewed it in his Guide and gave it his proverbial *1/2 rating usually allotted to such sensationalist fare. Even more surprising is the fact that I found this to be so good and engaging, despite being the nth revamping of one of my all-time favorites - Georges Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE (1959). Also, I expected it to be much trashier  considering the dubious epithet ""the first sex-horror film"" that's attached to it; there is a reasonable amount of nudity here, but this is generally tastefully presented. Actually, it exudes a rather classy atmosphere (with cinematography by the renowned Roger Fellous) peculiar to French horror cinema  similar, in fact, to other Mondo Macabro releases such as MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN (1960), THE DIABOLICAL DR. Z (1965), GIRL SLAVES OF MORGANA LE FAY (1971) and SEVEN WOMEN FOR Satan (1974).<br /><br />Lead Philippe Lemaire is appropriately debonair as the celebrated painter whose life and career take a nose-dive once his wife is no longer able to act as his muse; the actor later worked for Jess Franco and Walerian Borowczyk but, sadly, ended his own life in 2004. Anne Duperey is luscious and graceful during the early section of the film: the girl's loving relationship with her husband is presented in some detail, so as to render her subsequent bitterness (which even drives her to commit cold-blooded murder) both believable and poignant. The appearance of her scarred features, then, is subtly handled throughout (presented mostly as blurry POV shots) and the make-up itself quite well done. The actress eventually broke into the mainstream with PARDON MON AFFAIRE (1977), a successful comedy later Americanized as THE WOMAN IN RED (1984).<br /><br />Howard Vernon provides a further link with the EYES WITHOUT A FACE prototype  since he played the title role in Jess Franco's THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF (1961), a character to which actor and director would often return (the last time in FACELESS [1988], a viewing of which followed the next day). In THE BLOOD ROSE (released as RAVAGED in the U.K.), he again plays the surgeon who aims to graft the face off a live victim: here, however, he's blackmailed into the task and actually doubts his own success (his eventual fate, then, comes as a total shock). The dwarf manservants seen here may be something of a genre requisite, but they're actually well-integrated into the plot  their rape/murder of a captive girl (an intended, but obviously unwilling, face donor) and subsequent beating by their disfigured mistress seemed a gratuitous digression at first, but it does help set up the film's wild and completely unexpected final act! It's rather odd, however, that no revenge was visited upon the spited socialite who perpetrated Duperey's accident.<br /><br />The catacomb-like design of Lemaire's art gallery complements the Gothic atmosphere of his family château. As for the film's deliberate pace, this is characteristic of the ""Euro-Cult"" style  typified by the scene in which an inquisitive girl is made to prowl the castle grounds for minutes on end. Unsurprisingly, Mulot (who tragically drowned in 1986) later dabbled in porn cinema  though the obscure crime film THE CONTRACT (1971) is considered as his best work. The DVD supplements include an interesting 23-minute interview with the film's assistant director (and Mulot's brother-in-law), and a reasonably informative essay about the history of French horror cinema over the years (going all the way up to the most recent examples).",Plot,Directional Techniques,Others
"Pretty good Sci-Fi flick. In the vein of ""Pitch Black"" and the last 2 ""Alien"" movies. Should've been R rated. That could have given the director/actors more room to really explore the true terror these dragons were inflicting and could've been more graphic/dark. Not enough dragon sequences. Also, would've been much more plausible had it taken place in the 1930's or 1940's. That would help explain how we weren't able to deal the dragons. Also the much overused ending of a small band of humans with almost no weapons left being able to defeat the supreme enemy - in this case the Bull dragon - would work better in 1942 as opposed to 2020.

"Although it's fairly safe to state that David Cronenberg delivered his greatest work during the 1980's (with genuine masterpieces such as ""The Fly"", ""Scanners"" and ""The Dead Zone""), his 70's films definitely shouldn't be underestimated! Titles like ""The Brood"" or ""Rabid"" are solid cult-gems that truly proved that he was a gifted filmmaker whose talent would only increase with every new project he set his intelligent mind to. This ""Shivers"", released back in 1975, is yet another entirely different chapter in the Cronenberg success tale... It was the director's first long-feature film, made with an extremely low budget, but already showing his large interest in mixing shocking horror with subtle social criticism. Obviously inspired by the style and format of Romero's classic ""Night of the Living Dead"", the story focuses on the newest invention of some over-ambitious medics: genetically engineered parasites that are entered inside human guinea pigs and supposed to fully take over the functions of ill or dying organs. Naturally, this medical breakthrough isn't as effective as it should be, and all the inhabitants of a luxurious building complex are mutating into sex-craving zombies. In many ways, Cronenberg's cinematic debut feels like watching an authentic exploitation film! It's not just the low budget and the extreme use of gore; the odd casting, the twisted premise and the apocalyptic ending all feel very exploitation-like. Heck, this film even goes by several vicious alternate titles that sound like they only could have been invented by wicked exploitation distributors (for example: ""Orgy of the Blood Parasites"" or ""They Came from Within""). I surely don't intend to make all this sound like it's a negative thingon the contrary! ""Shivers"" is a truly bizarre and adrenalin-rushing movie containing loads of nasty gore, sleaze and morbid humor. Some of the dialogue is sensational (= ""man is an animal that thinks too much"" or ""dying is an act of eroticism"") and the fairly unknown cast does a great job portraying the sex-driven but mindless ""zombies"". There's a terrific supportive role for Barbara Steele! Nearly 15 years after her best role in ""Black Sunday"" she still is the yummiest witch queen of B-cinema! ""Shivers"" isn't exactly brilliant, but it's certainly better than most other contemporary horror films and it's a fascinating oddity showing where and how Cronenberg began his masterful career.

"Stephen King's ""Children of the Corn"" story is relatively short so most of what is in the movies has nothing to do with his story. This is the last of the movies I saw, but many more sequels would for some reason follow. The first movie did have some elements that were found in the book, this one only a few concepts remain as it does a lot of things differently this time around. For one, you do not get the creepy abandoned looking town you found in the first movie, which is a shame as it is what made that film for me. You also do not have really much of anything as far as development goes as this film is for the most part very forgettable. The story centers around what are supposedly survivors from the town in the last movie and for some reason it seems the corn is infecting them in ways that once again make them into bad children, or bad teenagers for the most part. Yes, I would have to say all these movies would be more aptly titled teenagers of the corn rather than children, though I can guess they do it so they do not traumatize a really young kid.",Directional Techniques,Others,
"This miserable picture is a prime candidate for the award of ""THE Worst Movie of All Time.""<br /><br />The production was OK; and most of the performances were not bad, given the ridiculous characters and situations the actors were required to portray.<br /><br />The script and plot, however, defined new depths of ""abominable,"" even by Hollywood standards.<br /><br />The way the prospective grandparents took over the ""production"" of bringing forth the offspring, was bad enough, but the way the writers treated Stanley Banks (Spencer Tracey, one of my favorite actors} was nothing short of sadistic.<br /><br />Here's this well-off, virile ""young"" (at 51 or so) man, who has just retired and looking forward to a blissful life with time and money to travel, and (whatever) with a gorgeous and (formerly) loving wife (Joan Bennett), and he's not only neglected and pushed into insignificance by the arrival of the new grandchild, but is actually kicked out of the bedroom!

When I write a script I read it at least 50-60 times and keep changing things until it makes sense. That's what a good writer does. You can't be happy with the first thing you write that's just wrong.<br /><br />The story could have been so good without the Isha Shravani character. Her character totally screwed up the plot and the story. Mr. Ghai needs to stop making formula films, not every film needs to have a love triangle. Stories can be told without triangles. Mr. Ghai needs to take some pointers from the like of Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Mani Ratnam. Stop making the same story over and over and over again. What an idiot! If you're out of ideas, don't make films anymore; we don't need to be tortured like this.<br /><br />Mr. Ghai needs to go back to film school and learn the latest techniques of film-making and story telling. I feel sorry for anyone who's attending his film school. Doesn't he realize that the audience is getting smarter...People will no longer accept the crap they dished out 10-20 years ago. This film is actually worst than the worst films they made 10-20 years ago.<br /><br />Mr. Ghai did everything in the film from Direction to Writing to Producing to Editing. He seems to be very proud of that fact because its there in BIG letters in the film...perhaps he should concentrate on just one thing and leave the others to professionals. Okay...I don't want to talk about Mr. Ghai anymoreHe's leaving a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />All the performances are average and I'm being generous here. The only one that stands out is a cameo by Sushmita Sen. Isha Shravani need to climb back up the rope she came down from. She can't act and the only reason it seems she's in this movie is because she can dance on a rope. That's the dumbest thing ever!! <br /><br />On the whole, I have never said this about a film, but...I WANT MY MONEY BACK...Don't waste your time or money on this one. Unless you want to see a girl spinning on a rope at 20 different parts of the film, for no reason what so ever, there is no reason to watch it. This is the by far the worst Subhash Ghai film ever. One expects more from him. DON""T WATCH IT AT ANY COST. Even if it's the last film left on earth, it's better not to see it. I'm so disappointed.

Beyond the obvious ""Christians are mean-spirited, busy-body, judgemental kill-joys"" theme, and the rest of the plot is a total cliché: feel-good, rich-boy-meets-poor-gold-digging-whitetrash-girl ...and they really fall in love, only to have him cut off by his rich father but they marry anyway and show THEM by living happily ever after.

"In a Mary Poppins meets Supernanny, entwined with an element of enchantment; Nanny McPhee will hopefully win several awards for best actress, best actor, best supporting actress and best supporting actor, best script and best director!! <br /><br />Emma Thompson, as terrific as ever, stars as Nanny McPhee, a mysterious nanny who is called to the aid of Mr. Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) a widower who is struggling to bring up his badly behaved children. With her mystical powers and unique ways she soon charms all seven children and helps them woo their father towards the attractive housemaid, Evangeline (Kelly McDonald). But the bliss is threatened by the arrival of Cedric's drag-queen, admirer (Celia Imrie)  <br /><br />Emma Thompson is the next Helen Mirren/Meryl Streep without a shadow of a doubt and here is a prime example. The clever make up and well acted performance adds to the authentic side to the film and also shows her how much she deserves another award. Colin Firth is posh and snobby  as always, but that's how we know him. Ha ah ha. He too is excellent in his role, as the workaholic Dad. Celia Imrie reveals her more evil side and is without doubt PERFECT as the over-made villain! It was also nice to see Angela Lansbury, now much older, in a cameo as Firth's domineering Aunt, but with an important role in the story. <br /><br />The SXF's are low key but terrific throughout the film. I particularly liked Emma Thompson's entrance  the camera zooming towards the manor from several different directions before she storms the screen. The script, also Thompson's work, is well written and enjoyable with jokes for the entire family as well as the well remembered quotes from all the characters. The set design is particularly eye catching, especially Imrie's house, personally it reminded me of Hansel and Gretal. <br /><br />Couples who are looking for a date flick, do NOT be put off because it's a U. Its perfect for a date flick! Not scary, good acting, British, good jokes, several cameos, touching and at a reasonable and appropriate pace. Parents who are looking for something to take the children to see  this is also ideal! For the exact same reasons. <br /><br />Don't really know what else to say, other than this could well be the film of 2005. Its quite simply perfect.

"A fine ""B"" movie cast is wasted by using awful production values in a project that likely ran out of money before it was finished. The tacked-on ending without a doubt uses different actors than the on-screen talent (Grant Williams, Mala Powers, Denny Miller, Bobby Van). Probably the WORST special effect is the destruction of the earth. ""The Doomsday Machine"" gets a ""3"" from me because it was at least always coherent. It's sad whatever happened during production prevented the movie from being filmed as intended. I feel especially bad for Grant Williams, a fine actor, who was likely blacklisted because of his sexual preferences, not to mention a well publicized feud with Jack Webb, then director of production for Universal. Better William be remembered for ""The Shrinking Man"" and ""Hawaiian Eye"" than this crap. Ditto, Mala Powers for ""The Time Travelers"".",Visual Effect,Others,
"I wanted to learn about the credit industry - a very important industry that gives us the ability to buy homes and education among many other things. Our access to capital is what differentiates us from third world countries that are not as well developed. Muhammed Yunus has recognized this and won a Nobel Peace Price for his micro-finance programs.<br /><br />There are negatives to the industry as well but the movie doesn't intelligently lay out any case - it just tries to get you to engage emotionally instead of engage in any type of critical thinking. What caused these people to get into debt? A message of personal responsibility was merely skated over.<br /><br />There were a few facts that are good to know, but many others were horribly inaccurate or half-truths. I will not cite any for fear of being a spoiler but am chomping at the bit to do so.<br /><br />Many people need education in credit/finance and it would be fabulous to have classes in high school to show how to use credit wisely (along with personal finance).

"This was a bad dramatisation of a classic. Although the cast had potential I couldn't help but feel that this dramatisation hammed up Sherlock Holmes horribly and failed to evoke the atmosphere and norms of Edwardian England. It was yet another remake that failed to provide a new insight into the story. I particularly disliked the characterisation of the relationship between Holmes and Watson - it seemed that Holmes held Watson permanently in contempt which is not something that I felt when reading the stories. Even Richard E. Grant was disappointing and seemed to be over acting - I suspect that was due to poor direction. <br /><br />For me the best dramatisation of this story is the Jeremy Brett version which combines wonderful acting, with a real sense of history and atmosphere. In fact for me the 'Jeremy Brett' series is the most authentic and atmospheric dramatisation of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes to date. If you want 'ham' look at the Basil Rathbone version which is wonderful in a different way and don't waste your time on this.",Directional Techniques,Others,
"Decidedly adult-oriented slapstick-comedy, though it was originally marketed towards the younger crowds, that has two very different brothers (played by comedians Nathan Lane and Lee Evans) suddenly left broke and homeless directly resulting from a couple of disturbing and rather unfunny circumstances. By what seems like pure luck the bumbling brothers inherit a dilapidated mansion at just the right time from their wealthy industrialist father (played by William Hickey) who has just recently passed away. Apparently the house, as they soon find out, was built by some well-known architect in the mid-nineteenth century ultimately making it very valuable and highly sought-after by a number of collectors. In the process of attempting to clean the place up so as to hold a big auction in it with hopes of selling it to the highest and wealthiest bidder the two men realize (much to their dismay) that the house's oldest resident, a tiny little mouse, is unwilling to give up his much loved abode without a fight! From that basic plot hilarity is supposed to ensue, but for a number of reasons it rarely does! One of the many things that bothered me about this flick and made it hard for me to laugh was the big fact that it was so dark, dank and just way too atmospheric for it's own good. Meaning that the seemingly unnamed time-period and or place that it's set in is far too unpleasant, grimy and gritty for an out-and-out comedy, let alone a kid's film! In fact it kind of reminds me of the sometimes graphic and violent ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City Of Lost Children""...dark and amoral, with a fairy-tale like theme and enormous and meticulous set designs. However, unlike those two films this one was inappropriately aimed towards children via the cartoon-like slapstick comedy reminiscent of the old ""Wily Coyote and The Road Runner"" and sorry but I gotta say it, ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons. Some curious cameos are also featured here from a number of character actors that are passable considering all, though to be honest I'm still scratching my head as to why any of them would have actually made appearances in this flick in the first place; the actors I'm in reference to are: Maury Chakin, Christopher Walkin (!?), the late Michael Jeter, the late William Hickey who passed away shortly after this film wrapped and who's memory it is dedicated to in the end credits, and Vicki Lewis. Overall, ""Mousehunt"" is not the worst film you could ever see that's for sure. However, in my opinion and this is just my opinion mind you, I don't think that it's really too fit for the kiddies out there frankly. Though, a number of the adult's are likely to get a kick out of this to a degree more or less, but I don't think that many of them will find it to be completely fall-down hilarious by any means.

"I want to make this perfectly clear. I've heard lots of people talking about this Monster From Green Hell film. It's all the rage with the kids today, I know. Well let me tell you what you're getting into with this film. There is no single monster in the film, there are several giant moths, that might be construed as monsters, but that would make the title MonsterS from Green Hell. Also, this Green Hell is talked about, I think, hard to hear through the terrible sound quality, but we never see it, and I'm pretty sure these moths didn't come from Green Hell. Plus the film's in black and white, thus there's no chance of seeing anything green. The proper title'd be Monsters from Dark Gray Hell. But I guess that doesn't have the same ring.<br /><br />This is a very bad, boring, long, repetitious movie. By general movie standards it's quite poor. Next to movies like Orgy of the Dead, it's damn near watchable. A bunch of scientists end up making giant wasps (Hate it when that happens) so they have to trek through darkest Africa to stop them or something. They honestly don't seem intent on stoping them, nor are they truly prepared to handle them when they find them (A good deal of the crew are slaughtered).<br /><br />The effects are bad, but you won't notice since the big bugs only appear in a cameo role at best...they're there in the beginning once or twice, then disappear until the ""action-packed"" finale. The rest of the time we're forced to sit through a rather tedious walk through of Africa, complete with stupid narration, idiotic characters, and some rather racist stuff as well (The white characters get a whole bunch of Africans to do all their dirty work for them, it's really all quite racist). And the white characters, well they can't get much whiter. One of them dresses in white as well, like Tom Wolfe on his most white day.<br /><br />Racial politics of the fifties aside, this movie isn't much fun, nor is it scary or even campy.

"A woman is taken terrible advantage of by a hypnotist in ""Whirlpool,"" a 1949 film starring Gene Tierney, Jose Ferrer, and Richard Conte, directed by Otto Preminger. Tierney is the wife of a successful psychiatrist who is caught shoplifting. She is helped by Ferrer, a hypnotist who steps in during her interrogation. He works with her to help her solve some of her problems, but he adds some other hypnosis as well.<br /><br />This isn't a great Preminger. The acting is good, but the script is weak. First of all, is it really possible to hypnotize someone that completely? I don't know. What I do know is that it's absolutely against all ethics to talk about a patient with anyone as freely as Conte does. Since a good deal of the plot hinges on his breaking of that doctor-patient privilege, the story doesn't hold up.<br /><br />Gene Tierney is her usual beautiful self. This is not, however, a role that plays to her strengths as an actress. She's sympathetic but doesn't explore the range of the role enough. She more easily played an icy or feisty type. In those days, as actresses neared 30, studios became less interested, and Tierney found herself in roles which she was not particularly right for - or that wasted her talent just to fulfill her contractual obligations. Ferrer is excellent as the oily hypnotist, keeping his voice even when he was saying the most outrageous things. Conte is very good as well as Tierney's husband.<br /><br />All in all, this was interesting to watch, but it could have been much better given the talent behind and before the camera.",Plot,Others,Performance
"Hook is one of those ""what if?"" stories that answers the question if Peter Pan grew up and stayed in our world and left the world of Neverland behind, and had a family of his own. <br /><br />In the 1990's Peter Pan is now a middle aged man with a lot of work on his head, his name is now Peter Banning. Peter puts work ahead of his family and has issues with his own family, especially his son Jack. They return to England, Peter's wife's home country where they meet her grandmother, Wendy Darling, again. Wendy is older and much more wiser with the world, and grows a fear on Peter, he's no longer the nice boy she once had many adventures with, he's a hard working man who has a cranky attitude for the most part. It's heartbreaking for her. t is till the legendary Captian Hook kidnaps Peter's children that he is reminded by Wendy of who he used to be, of course Peter can't believe it, he can't believe it even more when Tinkerbell pays a visit and carries him off to Neverland where he meets Captian Hook after so long. Hook is in disbelief that Banning is Peter Pan, but Tinkerbell promises she'll have been back into shape in a week, then their war shall continue. Hook agrees and that leaves Tinkerbell and the Lost boys to train Peter into being the boy he once was. <br /><br />The acting in this film is fantastic, Robin Williams embodies Peter Pan, Dustin Hoiffman embodies Captian Hook( tries to phone in on the Disney version), Bob Hoskins doe s great Smee, and Julia Roberts is decent as Tinkerbell. <br /><br />The direction is fantastic, classic Spielberg, it also brings in his taste in comedy and juvenile essence. <br /><br />The musical score by John Willaims is fantastic, as usual. <br /><br />Despite being a box office hit, Hook wasn't the film that Spielberg wanted to make, in the end, he isn't fond of it and frankly neither is Julia Roberts for that matter( take a look at the trivia, clearly she didn't have a good time as it would seem). <br /><br />Hook is undeniably a love or hate movie, but even after so long, I still like it, though I don't think I could call it a classic to be perfectly honest. <br /><br />7/10.",Plot,,

"A Children's Story... That is the best explanation that I can produce for this movie. It does not make sense. The plot is inconsistent. The actions of the protagonists and antagonists do not make sense. The story is mildly charming, but not particularly dramatic. And, children acting childish are major characters. OK, so it is a children's story.<br /><br />I remember when children's stories had a logical progression of the story line. Maybe that is the fault of my Western linear thinking, brought up short by Mel Gibson's Australian background.<br /><br />I cannot explain what bothers me with the movie without describing the plot. Capt Dan is in love with a woman. Before he can work up the nerve to ask her to marry him, she gets knocked into a coma. Doctors give her no chance of ever waking up. Capt. Dan can't face the prospect of going through life without her, so he asks his friend--who happens to be running a suspended animation experimental project so secret that not even his own bosses know what he is doing--to put him under for a year (or whenever his love awakes). While he is out, things happen, his capsule gets misplaced, and, before we know it, 53 years have gone by.<br /><br />Thermos should make such a dewar as the capsule that held Capt. Dan. It kept him cold without external power for half a century. Tragically, no one recorded the date that those mischievous kids opened his capsule. Oddly, he managed to thaw out on his own and live to tell about it.<br /><br />OK, so he wakes up without aging, 53 years later. He meets up with a nurse. It's a good thing she is a nurse because... actually, for no particular reason. Sure, there is an escape sequence set up in the hospital, but she could just as easily have been a janitor for it. Maybe that would have improved the drama, who knows? Love could have bloomed between Capt Dan and Nurse Cooper; that would have been logical. After all, here is a young man with no one else, and those two have hit it off just fine together. But, then comes the discovery Capt. Dan's true love actually recovered from her coma and is still alive! Now, obviously, Helen has aged 53 years, while Capt. Dan hasn't. A viewer might think that with the title of this movie, that Capt. Dan doesn't age. Wrong! It turns out that Capt. Dan's aging is irreversible... a word the author apparently mistakes for inevitable. After all, no one was attempting to reverse anyone's aging; they were simply delaying it. Never mind; Capt. Dan ages all 53 years within a few days. Mother Nature will not be cheated, even if theater-goers are.

It seems that the widely-reported car accident that killed his countries King was no accident but in fact a cold-blooded assassination by a terrorist group. He ask's Holmes & Watson to escort the King's son, who lives in London for his protection, back home to take his rightful place on the throne & restore some stability to the country. Holmes agrees & the plan is for him to travel with the King by plane while Watson acts as a decoy & travels to the Mediterranean country by boat.

Have the terrorists won? Or is there more to the case than first meets the eye? Watch it to find out...<br /><br />Produced & directed by Roy William Neill Pursuit to Algiers was the twelfth Holmes film in a series that totals ten made between 1939 & 1946 to star Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson. The script by Leonard Lee is based on the novel 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes' by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as isn't really a mystery, it's more of a thriller & not a particularly good one either. No-one is murdered which is disappointing as I like a good murder mystery so to have a character like Holmes running around foiling a few lame assassination attempts is both a wasted opportunity & felt uninspired. Wouldn't an assassin just shoot his target with a gun & be done with it rather than coming up with silly plans like placing a bomb in someone's party cracker! I found little here to interest or entertain me, I thought it was too predictable & plodding but at only 65 minutes long at least it's short.<br /><br />Director Neill does his usual competent job but this won't impress many these days although you have to remember this film was made over sixty years ago. The horror & mystery overtones that are ever-presents throughout the rest of the series are totally lacking here which was not a good decision in retrospect.<br /><br />Technically the film is OK although the ship is obviously a stage. The black and white cinematography is fine. The acting is alright, Rathbone looks a bit disinterested this time around & who can blame him? Bruce as Watson plays the likable buffoon as well as ever.<br /><br />Pursuit to Algiers came as a big disappointment to me as the other's I've seen in this series have all been very good films.

"Malcolm in the Middle is important for a very strange reason: much less the Drew Carey Show, it's one of those examples where the show lasted three seasons longer than it had to, and becomes one of those strange 'abondoncoms' in which anybody who works on the show is recognized for being on the show, but has to remind everybody that it wasn't cancelled three years ago. It was just shifted off to compete against Survivor or something more culturally relevant. Or got the fabled Futurama deathslot before the important Simpsons/Seth McFarlane trifecta.<br /><br />Does this mean it was a good show? Honestly, it suffered greatly from the puberty curse. Taking a glimpse at the hyped 'series finale' it's clear that the show probably would have been better served if it just gave up the ghost about three years ago. The situations are effective for smaller children, but when those children are sporting horrible acne, cracking voices, and puberty mustaches it comes off as sad and desperate. In fact, when it comes down to history, Malcolm in the Middle can be summed up in two ways:<br /><br />1) As a skit on Family Guy that showcases how annoying the mother is. 2) As more ammo against Frankie Muniz when his career turns into game show appearances or episodes of Cops as the perfect juxtaposition between 'sitcom family life' and 'child predator/drunken mess/druggie/meth addict who gets caught urinating in a gutter and beaten by cops.'<br /><br />Malcolm is an example of sitcom days gone by. If this ran on NBC during the big Cheers/Seinfeld/Friends decade, then it would have ran for nine years, supported on bigger shows. But those times are gone, perhaps forever, and it's hard to see how this show is going to make an impact when nobody remembers it exists until the series finale is used as gum to keep people watching until Family Guy. Unfortunately for this reviewer, that ploy didn't work.<br /><br />Malcolm in the Middle is dead, but that's not the bad news.

"This film is a dreadful piece of work, hardly worth a second thought except for one reason - it illustrates the use of entertainment media for propaganda purposes.<br /><br />Arguably, the film's most credible character is climatologist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse), who describes evidence of plants growing within 90 miles of the North Pole (despite the fact that there is no land above sea level that close to the Pole), and who describes data from about a dozen CO2 monitoring stations which each report about a 1% increase in atmospheric CO2 - then she concludes from this data that Earth has experienced an alarming 12% increase in CO2. Fortunately, this error was not included in the IPCC's report on climate change, but for every one person who reads a peer-reviewed journal article on climatology, there are thousands of people who saw this film. My concern is that these casual viewers could have been misled by the pretend science.<br /><br />Because the rise of atmospheric CO2 is central to the film's plot, I believe the writers had a duty to check the numbers - either make the total equal to the average of the several stations' data, or have the (fictional) stations all report data that averages to 12%. I don't think this was an accident - I believe the writers wanted to make our present situation (real life CO2 increases near 1%) seem scarier, so they deliberately misrepresented the global average by 12 times. If a real climatologist had published a paper built around an error of this type, they would be discredited and virtually unemployable in their field. This makes the film a propaganda piece, a deliberate attempt - way back in 1996 - to ""sell"" the global warming agenda with fraudulent, alarmist, inflated data.",Plot,Others,

"After having re-visited Harryhausen's Sinbad trilogy recently, I have decided that this one, overall, compares very favourably with the other two. It is the most epic of the trilogy and has the most ambitious storyline (POSSIBLE SPOILER) involving a voyage into a lost world hidden behind the ice sheets at the North Pole (no doubt an idea partly influenced by Disney's 1974 'The Island at the Top of the World').<br /><br />The creatures in this one are the least spectacular of the trilogy (THE SEVENTH VOYAGE & THE GOLDEN VOYAGE have better and more spectacular ones) but Harryhausen's artistry is as great as ever and he really should have been given a special accolade for imbuing Kassim the Baboon and the Troglodyte with so much character. It really is remarkable watching them 'act'. Demanding kids may find the creatures disappointing but now that I am older I can appreciate the fine work that went into realising them. Harryhausen's puppet work possesses a tangibility that CGI is only just now coming close to emulating.<br /><br />I also find that I care about the characters in this film and what happens to them. The woodenness of the acting and the dialogue of the previous 2 films in some way stopped me from caring very much. This picture does not suffer in the same way, as both acting and dialogue, while nothing special, are better here. Jane Seymour is also very easy on the eye and is the best looking Sinbad girl of them all.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for young (but not very young) children and for adults who were kids when it first came out and want to recapture some nostalgic vibes. I feel that this one is best for a sense of epic adventure and empathetic characters, THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is best for the monsters and THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD is quite possibly the best of the trilogy overall.",Visual Effect,Directional Techniques,
"First off, I'm a huge believer in the existence of Aliens, abduction, implants, crop circles etc. etc. etc. (Did you just hit Not Useful already?? Jerk-off.) So, prior to this movie, I had decently high expectations. I wanted a movie that would deliver an intriguing story but at the same time give lots of interesting facts. Low and behold, my expectations were met and the movie delivered on both accounts.<br /><br />At Major Jesse Marcel's 30th Anniversary for his Nuclear Bomb Unit, he's set on getting the facts straight about what he experienced and what went on during the Roswell incident. Through flashbacks mostly, the movie retells what most probably occurred.<br /><br />With an intriguing and important story being told in a entertaining way, the movie succeeds more than it fails. The acting overall, is kinda average, especially by Kyle MacLachlan, but with an always impressive Dwight Yoakam, and a usually solid Martin Sheen, the movie also ends up succeeding here as well. Overall, Roswell was a entertaining film that delivers a nice story with some nice knowledge concerning the incident. If you're even slightly interested in aliens or Roswell, and if you get the chance to watch this movie, don't hesitate, it's easily worth the 90 minutes.",Performance,Plot,
"This ground breaking movie, much like the ground breaking sounds of NIN, '?' has been discussed, praised, shunned, ripped and probably copied since, that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genius-ly original film, and when experienced over and over again, STILL never fails to amuse.<br /><br />This movie is one of the few I would describe as genuinely ""unique"" and ""stellar"". I honestly cannot fault many things about it, except a bit too long??? The brilliant dialogue, the fantastic group of actors, who range from everywhere (in age and ethnicity, even to inanimate objects), are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is the coolest of any independent film (which rarely ever have one), I have ever heard. The band Hideous Input is awesome! <br /><br />In short, this is an indie classic, and required viewing for all black comedy buffs, especially demented nuts like myself.

"With Tarzan (Johnny Weismuller) and Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) nicely settled into their treetop des-res (complete with all mod cons), it was only going to be a matter of time before we heard the pitter patter of little footsteps (other than Cheetah's, of course). However, with the Hays Code in full effect, and our arboreal lovebirds not actually wed, they sure weren't going to be permitted to have a child of their own via the normal method.<br /><br />The writers of the Tarzan series get around this problem by having a child delivered from the sky by 'the great metal stork'a plane that crashes in the jungle with a baby boy as the only survivor. Cheetah finds the wailing bundle of joy and whisks him off to Tarzan and Jane, who decide to adopt the lad, naming him Boy (Tarzan's second choice, after having Elephant rejected by Jane).<br /><br />Five years of blissful family life later, and an expedition turns up at the escarpment searching for the plane and any possible survivors. But Tarzan and Jane have become rather attached to their little tyke, and aren't about to give him up, especially when they discover that two of the visitors only want Boy for his vast inheritance.<br /><br />Aimed at the matinée crowd, this particular instalment features none of the graphic nastiness or raciness that can be found in the first two Tarzan films (the obligatory native killing at the end of the filmvia a huge skull-cracking deviceis brief and non-explicit); instead, we get mild peril as Boy is attacked by pipe-cleaner tarantulas and a back-projected rhino, comic relief courtesy of Cheetah the chimp, and a lot of fun interplay between Tarzan and his 'son', the best scene being an impressively shot moment of underwater horseplay.<br /><br />6.5 out of 10, happily rounded up to 7 for the bit where Cheetah turns his lips inside-out to amuse the new arrival (which makes me laugh just thinking about it).",Plot,Visual Effect,

"I was very fortunate last night, as I had a chance to see AINOA in a sneak preview almost half a year prior to its scheduled start over here in Austria. I was instantly thrilled as I heard a lot about this ambitious project in the past two years! And I learned a lot last night... For starters, Austrian actors synchronizing themselves for the English dubbed version - the one I saw - does not work. At all! It sounds odd and sometimes plain stupid. But as AINOA is a low budget project, it is an understandable decision. Unfortunately one that hurts the movie a lot along the way. Secondly, the movie fails to introduce its main characters properly in the beginning. Therefore the audience - and I am not just talking about myself here - felt not nearly as tied in with the story as intended by the writer and director. Dramatic, sometimes even tragic moments felt as witnessed in a news broadcast far away. And then there is the pace of the story, which is more like a crawl than a rush. Only at the end - the last 20mins or so - does the pace pick up a bit and the movie starts getting interesting, as all the loose ends start coming together. On the positive side, the production design was really well done considering the extremely low budget that the designers had to cope with. The camera angles are often unique as well and give the entire scenery a strange sense of familiarity although they are actually portraying future scenarios. Great idea! The bottom line, as sad as it is, is this: Had the characters been properly introduced and the dubbing been done right, this could well have been a marvelous SiFi epic. As it is though, all the good intentions fall flat on their faces.",Others,Directional Techniques,

"""White Palace"" is one of my favorite movies, and I am amazed at the negative comments about Susan Sarandon's armpits. They clearly are part of her character, and she is to be commended for going to the extra effort to fit herself into the part (exactly as Demi Moore did in ""We're No Angels""). Gillette created the woman-shaving fad in the 1930's as a successful effort to double their razor sales. Then in the late 60's, young women stopped wearing makeup and stopped shaving as part of ""the natural look."" In the early 1970's, the cosmetic companies unleashed a media blitz to get women away from this natural look. <br /><br />They were successful, and heavy makeup (even cartoonish) and shaving became a fad again. The current advertising in the U.S. is designed to make women feel insecure and unattractive. Then it tells them they can be acceptable and beautiful if they wear the latest (and most expensive) gunk, and scrape off every bit of body hair below their eyebrows. Women have completely bought into it. Personally, I like women to look natural and not wear thick makeup (or any, in fact); I feel that they are much prettier without it.",Plot,Performance,Others
"This film is terrible. What makes this all the more unfortunate is that the film has a solid idea and a great cast. The idea was used to much better advantage in Abbott and Costello's 1942 comedy for Universal ""Ride 'em Cowboy"". Coincidentally Dick Foran also appears in that film although as a character similar to Dick Powell's, the phony cowboy. Pat O'Brien plays his standard fast talking promoter to perfection but adds very little to the proceedings. It's hard to believe that this was the same year that he did both ""Boy Meets Girl"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", both co-starring James Cagney. The songs are less than memorable.

"One of the weaker episodes. Why? For being a great show and all the plot build up the writers of Supernatural had a hard task at hand. No one can blame the writers for the story climax of season two being such a let down. The town, the special kids duel and Sam's mother knowing the demon where all cheesy. The story would have made a great regular episode, but the writers had hard time trying too match the brilliance of the season one's final episode. I was not surprised if the writers are tring to add new ideas for the season 3 story lines. 7 out of 10. I feel like there is a need for more.

"I don't usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time I feel I have to. I have spoken of taste in another review, saying it's all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film, if you like it, it simply means you have bad taste.<br /><br />I love films. I loved ""Isle of the Dead"" which is pretty much an unknown B&W film. I even liked ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movie"" I liked these films because they have, if not a lot, at least something good about them. I appreciate 99.9% of the films I've seen because they tell a story which I haven't heard before, and most directors only make films with a good storyline. Throughout this film I was thinking ""Where is this going?"" (even near the end) ""Where did they get these awful actors from""? ""Was that supposed to be a joke?"" and suchlike. With the obvious twist looming I was sceptical, but hoped it would perhaps ""make"" the film and prove I hadn't wasted my time. I was sadly mistaken. The storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was. Here's a rundown: Storyline  much like the first film, which was alright, this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations. The situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable. The twist was terrible, it didn't make me feel a thing, like excitement or WOW. Just ""My GOD."" There was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think ""Oooo wasn't that clever"" because it wasn't. In ""Fight Club"" there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where Tyler's true identity was cryptically shown, and when you watched it again you saw more, it really was a work of genius, how it was written, laid out and directed. This was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist. I think it was ""wild things"" that had like a pretty poor double twist and I still liked the film because the rest was OK and it wasn't trying too hard to be a big twist. Its like the CI2 writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever. But really, its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end. The film ended almost immediately afterward, with the whole film void by Sebastian's whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced, paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl. Acting  the actors in this film are appalling. Almost as bad a ""Sunset Beach."" - Extremely corny and badly performed. It's not even so bad it's good like ""Hunk"". The worst acting I thought came from Amy Adams who played Kathryn, it was a rigid, pathetic and badly thought out performance by her. Robin Dunne was also poor. I haven't seen ""American Psycho II"" yet, but no doubt his laid back ""cool"" style has ruined that film also.<br /><br />I can't even say it is a good film for teens, as its not. If my son or daughter liked this film I'd be ashamed. But they wouldn't anyway, as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film, which this film has none of. Really. I'm disappointed that some have said ""you might not be in the age bracket for this film, and so dislike it"" I like all the films now that I liked as a teen and had very good taste. Also, do you really think that when you reach 20+ you suddenly don't like any teenish story lines? No. I liked ""Mean Girls"" and other generic teen films, and watch ""Beverly Hills 90210"" all the time. There's no excuse for poor directing, acting and screenplay I'm afraid. Besides, I was 16/17 when I first watched it. If anything, being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film. I can't believe anyone can give it 10/10 either, one of my favourite films is ""Memento"" and I gave it 9 as I know there can be better. It is a shame for this site that people do that, give 10s flippantly, or don't get the films/show, and so give it 2.<br /><br />Anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste, and perhaps their lives, and with this realise that this is the worst film EVER made. (worse than ""Loch Ness"")<br /><br />If you aren't a teenager with bad taste, or simply don't have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film.",Performance,Directional Techniques,Plot

And all the shots of Guerin (Blanchett) smirking sideways at the camera -- it seemed like the filmmakers lost perspective. The story is remarkable and important, and there is so much talent in this movie, it's a pity that whatever happened in the execution didn't work to show the film's story as the amazing tale it is. I do not like criticizing films harshly, but for people with so much money and talent and resources -- what happened? The fact is, this movie should have been great. The story is great.

"There are so many things wrong with POLTERGEIST II that it's not worth listing all of them. Suffice it to say, I find this movie very depressing, mainly because of Heather O'Rourke and her untimely death after making POLTERGEIST III. It's difficult to watch a movie about evil characters trying to kill Heather when you know she died as a kid in real life. The other depressing aspects are everything else in this movie: story & script, acting, special effects, etc. It's bad and nothing works. The scene when Craig Nelson vomits that monster is stupid. The horror elements are totally disjointed and don't make any sense at all. But the worst thing about this sequel, aside from the scenes taking place on the other side, is the fact that this big budget movie is only 87 minutes long and yet if feels like it's three hours long. Such a short running time for such a big studio project is ALWAYS a bad sign (a lot of stuff must have been edited out) and in this case, it's true. Take away the time for the opening and closing credits, and the movie is probably 77 minutes long. That's only 1 hour and 17 minutes.

There was only one person I couldn't stand at times, and that was Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick). This was because she kicked Eddie in the groin. Plus, she said some things about him that were not very nice. If I caught my husband red-handed with another woman the way Grace did, I would probably get a divorce, especially if my daughter had seen what was going on.

"""Official Denial"" easily overcomes it's budget constrained special effects with a fast moving, highly intelligent script.

"Takashi Miike is really a paradox; he can be right in your face and at the same time be pensive. ""Izo"" is perhaps most representative of this paradox. No doubt, ""Izo"" is extremely violent and brutal, yet one sees a message lurking in the blood. I have read multiple interpretations on this film, and I myself see it as a ""search for God"" and humanity getting in the way of it. Others have seen it as an anti-war film. You may find a completely different interpretation. In these multiple interpretations lies the brilliance of the film. You must also watch the movie in a very abstract level, as opposed to the ""standard"" plot, with the characters and places as symbols. Those who are used to the dark humor and inventive violence of Miike's previous films like ""Audition"" and ""Ichi the Killer"" won't find it here--the violence is pretty straight forward (but still graphic), and there is no humor here. Miike probably made his most serious film to date with this film.",Others,,
"As the Bourne series raises the bar for action films, and audiences balk at two-plus hour runtimes, the filmmakers of Vantage Point seem like they are trying to bring a fresh, new, unconventional take on the action/thriller genre. Though it may annoy some people, I felt the new take turns Vantage Point into a taut terrorist thriller.<br /><br />The new take or approach is jumping right into the moment (everything is already planned out, people and weapons in place, etc.) of the action and then telling it from eight different points of view. This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.<br /><br />Because of the complex twists and turns of the plot and characters I will be brief, very brief actually, on the plot. It starts with a TV network covering a large gathering of leaders from all over the world (including the President of the United States) who have come together to form an alliance against the war on terror. At the beginning of this meeting the US president is assassinated as he takes the stage, and it begins replaying the assassination through all the different points of view. The editing must be commended in this film as it blends all the points of views so sophisticatedly you cannot help being engrossed, and the star-studded cast includes Dennis Quaid, Mathew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver simply adds to everything.<br /><br />In the theater I was watching some people called out their annoyance of ""again?!"" on the fifth rewind, which I find amusing as the filmmakers are simply trying to come up with something new in these sequel-ridden times. And probably as those same people say Hollywood is ""out of ideas"" they get angry when it tries something ""different"" and would rather go spend their money on Spider-man 8.<br /><br />I felt Vantage Point was an intelligent thriller, and yes it had its' share of implausible plot points, but these were minor as the new technique makes you feel like you have an all-seeing surveillance system. I kind of felt like I was putting a puzzle together, piece by piece, and as you see a new point of view it adds more to the story and just when you think you have it figured out it changes again.",Plot,Visual Effect,

"After being kissed by a kabuki master, Harry Griswold (police detective) transforms into the superhero Kabukiman. Harnessing his new kabuki powers, he faces corrupt businessmen, drug-dealing ministers... and must prevent the monkey from riding the jaguar.<br /><br />I first watched this film years (2000?) ago at my friend Jason's apartment and loved it, as I love all Troma releases. Today I watched it for the second time after picking up the DVD at Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors in Chicago 2007 from the director himself, Lloyd Kaufman. The movie was everything I remembered it being and more.<br /><br />The humor is cheesy and full of bad puns, the acting is decent but not Oscar-worthy, and some scenes are just not politically correct (though by far much less gross than any other Troma movie ever made). We get the first instance of the legendary car crash scene and some good fights. Heck, even the flying special effect is tolerable. Though after seeing ""Puma Man"" pretty much all flying scenes are tolerable.<br /><br />Troma is known for their anti-capitalism views, and it shows here (though more subtle than in ""Troma's War"" or ""Terror Firmer""). I mean, the villains are a business tycoon and a reverend! This is a strength for the films, I feel, because it really helps the target audience rally around the hero. If you're watching these films and enjoying them, clearly you like independent films, which makes you a natural for being opposed to huge organizations. Or maybe it's just me.<br /><br />So, yes. Cheesy plot and acting. A little gore (but not too much). Some bare breasts for no good reason. It's everything you expect from Troma, though more tame and with a little more plot.

"Do the readers of the posted comments for this film notice that the raves are coming from those who saw it at a gay and lesbian film festival somewhere? I don't know why but so many people who see films at festivals overrate them, as if the slightest gay reference in a film automatically makes it good. I missed it at last year's Outfest in LA, and heard that it was really good. I also wondered why it took over a year for this film to get released. Having finally gotten a chance to see it at a regular theater, I now know why. It was TERRIBLE! I can't understand why another Outfest entry that I saw--""The 25th Day"" with hotties James Marsden and Scott Speedman went direct to video, and they bothered to release this trashy film. I am a fan of horror films. Hellbent is really the first ""gay"" slasher picture. Too bad it had to be done this badly--poor script, mediocre direction, laughable dialogue, paper-thin characters, an ending that can only be described as a complete let-down, and no insight whatsoever as to the killer. If you saw the poster to this film and the first make-out scene in the film, you saw the best part of the movie. Only the drag queen character was able to make any kind of lingering impression. The actor resisted the temptation to make his character campy, and so we have sympathy for him. Otherwise, don't waste your money. I am out 10 bucks and 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back! I hope more talented gay filmmakers will try there hand at this genre, which has proved itself so profitably to str8 audiences. Openly gay filmmakers and writers such as Victor Salva (""Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2"") and Kevin Williamson (the ""Scream"" movies and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" movies) have so far given us ""eye candy"" in the form of hunky guys, but their movies so far are engineered to mainstream str8 audiences. They have had their success commercially. It is time for them to ""come out"" and make a truly gay horror film like this one. What do they have to lose? Be yourselves, for Godsakes--don't pretend to be str8. Write what you know about and what you feel (that is, lust for guys, not for girls).

However as with so many others its laughs all round, due to the shockingly bad script, plot etc. As far as the acting goes, well the less said about most of the cast the better, but a couple of leads aren't to bad, just the script lets them down.<br /><br />As far as gore goes, this film is very tame even by 80's standards. I put this down more to the low budget (which by the way is LOW), resulting in some very laughable effects, like jam looking blood and fake flies... There's a couple of good bits one where a guy has his hand chopped off, another where a guy has his head beaten in by a rock, but the effects are so lame that anyone affected by this film, really needs to look to seeking help.<br /><br />I think Forrest of Fear is a clear example of one of those films that the BBFC & Police simple stuck on the nasties list most probably due to the outrage at zombie flicks in general at the time. Certainly even by 1980's standards its laughable that this film could fall under the category of an 'obscene publication'. The fact the film still today remains banned in the UK, is not due in any respect to any offencive material, but due I'm sure to the fact that no distributor can be bothered to resubmit the film to the BBFC.<br /><br />My advice, avoid this unless your into super low budget, terrible 80's zombie flicks.

"A Hammer vampire movie directed by Jimmy Sangster, let me get through this proper review as quickly as possible before getting to the main reason I love this movie and rate it so highly.<br /><br />It's not the best Hammer movie and the tale, all about an infernal clan who can avoid death and then feed off the blood of the living, is nothing that unique. The setting (an all-girl school) is enjoyable enough for male viewers and the cast, for it's time, even throws is something to keep the ladies happy in the presence of dapper Michael Johnson. Others appearing include Ralph Bates, Barbara Jefford and the very pretty Suzanna Leigh.<br /><br />But they are not the reason for me wanting to see this movie for years and years. Oh no, not at all. That dubious honour belongs to the one and only Yutte Stensgaard. A woman so beautiful that I pined for her long before my young mind knew quite what I was pining for (having only seen her in pictures and never managing to have caught her on screen). Her acting skills are quite, quite bad and she doesn't have much in the way of actual personality but, good grief, Yutte remains one of the loveliest women I have ever lusted after in movie form and is absolutely the right choice for a film with this very title. Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder but it's my eye and my decision to rate this particular Hammer horror a 7/10 based on little more than my enjoyment of the woman I have been smitten with for many, many years.<br /><br />See this if you like: The Vampire Lovers, Twins Of Evil, The Hunger.",Plot,Others,
"It's an ode for good teachers! It's a film that asks you to slow down and inhale the best scents of life's memories quoting Cicero's line about actors leaving the stage quietly after achieving their best! It's a film that brings to mind Mazursky's ""Harry and Tonto"" and Bruce Beresford's ""Tender Mercies"".<br /><br />The story is great and performances real. Maureen O'Hara in her eighties is really wonderful to look at (compare her withered hands to her great face) and to hear. Her enunciation of spoken English is a treat for the ears.<br /><br />The film is more of a play on film but the editing is so smooth that you feel one scene weaves in to the next. The film does not stun you but endears you psychologically. The film involved the work of three writers at three stages. Probably Beth Polson had much to do with making the story good for cinema, may be it was Dalene Young. The film is great because of the contribution of three good writers, a charming Maureen O'Hara and fine editing. The direction of Kevin Dowling and the cinematography of Larry Reibman, though not outstanding, was above average.<br /><br />",Performance,Others,

"First off the book Johnny Tremain is both one of the greatest children stories and one of the greatest revolutionary war novels ever written. Published during the Second World War it has never gone out of print since and rightly so. As source material it is perfectly suited to be given a movie adaption. And when the movie sticks to following the book it is rather entertaining in a 1950s Disney sort of way.<br /><br />The first half hour is close enough to the book to entertain the fans. The character of Johnny has been changed from arrogant and cocky to pure and innocent in the best tradition of Disney films which can hardly come as a surprise but to expect anything else out of a kid's movie is to be let down. The second half hour loses the mood but keeps near the plot. The Boston Tea Party is entertaining although the singing after it is unforgivably Disney. But by the last half hour the book is thrown to the winds as we see the war first hand. Something about seeing laughing children dancing around the countryside shooting at redcoats struck me as kind of disturbing for a Disney film. Obviously war was a great adventure that people could enjoy in a typical '50s fashion where nobody but the bad guys got hurt and everyone could share a nice drink afterward. Oh, and somebody who is supposed to die, whose death gives the entire book meaning, doesn't. That would be too dark for a Disney film.<br /><br />Now if I thought that any of those additions were beneficial to the movie I couldn't really complain but none of them worked. The first battle was alright but the psychotic killing kids having fun was just awful. The producers probably couldn't see why this might be considered 'creepy'. The acting from the lead is awful and he doesn't seem to have been in anything else afterward. The guy playing Rab seemed to bring a little of the distant charm described in the book but the script doesn't give him more than one or two moments. Walter Sande as Paul Revere was good as were a few of the founding fathers but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />On the plus side the sets are marvelous. I've never seen colonial Boston come to life so well since, largely due to an absence of Revolutionary War films. The Battle of Lexington is moderately well done rather obviously leaving open the question of who fired first. And the first half hour entertains. So in conclusion: good book, good sets, bad everything else. Remake anyone?",Music,Visual Effect,
"Although Lon Chaney's ""Count Alucard"" is the character the movie is titled for, it's Louise Allbritton--as the Count's not-so-faithful bride--who is the real star here. In fact, I was more than a bit surprised at how little Lon seems to be in this picture or how rarely he opens his mouth, though I guess it doesn't take a lot of seeing Chaney on-screen to notice how ill-suited he is at portraying a Hungarian count; much less a count who is supposed to be from the same gene pool as Bela Lugosi.<br /><br />And yet, despite the miscasting of the male vampire, ""Son of Drac"" still turns out to be a very good old-school horror. Certainly one of the best of Universal's second cycle, and a film that in no way deserves the bad reputation it's received over the years. Even though Chaney wasn't the world's most convincing Hungarian, his performance is not a washout. He has quite a few effective moments, particularly when it comes to displaying the supernatural strength of the undead.<br /><br />Louise Allbritton, Frank Craven and J. Edward Bromberg all do tremendous work in this picture & I have to give props to Robert Paige for breaking from the usual ""dull-as-dishwater"" pattern that one normally sees from the romantic male leads in these old horrors (John Harker anyone). Imagine a guy you don't mind seeing defeat the monster instead of the opposite.<br /><br />And to top it all off, the ending is not the usual formula of two photogenic people walking off into the sunset. 'Son of Dracula' is a very good vampire thriller.",Music,Others,
"This is a neat pre-code film. William Powell gives his usual stand out performance. I've always had a problem, however, with leading lady, Ann Harding. She is one of my least favorite actresses. In this film, she is trying to hook up with Powell, but she looks more like his mother than lover/wife. She is, without a doubt, a good actress--but (like Miriam Hopkins)just not attractive enough. Henry Stephenson, as Harding's father was fine as was Lilian Bond, who played a gal friend of Powell. Ms. Bond was not a marriage type match as she was clearly not the settling down type @ all.

"This is a totally unexpected find, a movie that you know nothing about when you sit down to watch it, yet totally engrosses you and blows you away. While the plot involves the seduction of a vulnerable female by two co-workers, the sub-plot is a dark look at the corporate world with an ending that will hit you in the gut. In the Company of Men should be watched by men, only with other men, and not with their significant female others. One of my favourites. Highly recommended for those who like dark comedies.",Plot,Visual Effect,Performance
"I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I had seen Jacquet's previous movie (march of the penguins) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio. However, I was severely disappointed. Most of all, this movie is terribly boring. Literally NOTHING happens. I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like ""well then the winter comes, and then spring, and then there's an eagle, and a river, and one time it is dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and another time the fox has babies"" and so on. After about half an hour I began sighing, yawning, rolling my eyes, cursing the reviewer at the radio station, and hoping that it would be over soon. But the movie went on and on. When it finally ended I had sunken so deep into my chair that I must have looked somewhat similar to Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the movie are (a) The girl, who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with. She wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie (one year), and shows exactly two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness. She is cute, no question about that. However, a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all-too-human presence. I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear, drown in the river, or something similarly terrible. (b) The commentary by the girl's adult voice, which tells us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring, redundant things. (c) The music, which is desperately lacking subtlety. When the girl is happily jumping around, the music jumps around, too. When the fox is threatened by an eagle, the music becomes threatening, too. It reminded me of the very early days of film-making, and was just too predictable to enjoy. Admittedly, many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it, at least they got somehow involved. Thus, my warning concerns adults only: If you are over ten years old, avoid this movie. You can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places.",Others,Performance,
"It was gruesome and full of strange oddities. The basic plot of a man force feeding women to death is the basic key of desire to want to watch this movie. Well, besides the crime investigator, and the hardcore sex, thats basically what you see in this movie. A woman being fattened up until she's so morbidly obese that she cannot live on her own, and is basically bet on for how huge she can get and how long she will stay alive as an extremely fat woman.

If you wanted to watch something that scars you for a while, then in that case I deeply suggest you stay out of watching this movie!Evren Buyruk",Directional Techniques,Visual Effect,
"First off, I am a big fan of Brian Yuzna's work, as well as frequent partner Stuart Gordon. I felt this film, was way better then Rottweiler, or Faust, which suffered greatly from a miscast lead. I'll get the negative stuff out of the way first. There were a couple underwater shots, that didn't quite measure up to the rest of the film, and being that the actors had different nationalities, some of the performances came off as uneven, due to the language barrier. Most of this was shot in English from what I could tell, although the boys' in the opening sequence may have been dubbed. Now on to the overwhelming majority, which was good. The villain was creepy, and the actor gave a spectacular performance. The story was fascinating, and the sets, and makeup effects were the stuff of horror classics. There was a time, after the excellent opening, that I was leaning more towards putting this film in the interesting, but deeply flawed category Rottweiler and Faust are in, but ultimately for me the good far outweighed the bad. The bizarre finale, really reminded me of Yuzna's work in the unheralded classic Society. My advice, stick with it, it's not quite a great film, but it's a very good one.",Others,,
"X-Men is my favourite comic book series, I have been a fan of the comic books and the animated series in the 90s and I was excited when I found out that they were making an X-Men film. I was round 14/15 at the time it was released and the only bad thing about my experience seeing the film was the popcorn (American can't make sweets to save their lives).<br /><br />X-Men is a wide ranging series which tackles a lot of plots and issues. It has been considered to be a metaplor for the civil rights movement in the 60s and the comics have tackled other issues like the role of the government, the AIDs virus and the Holocaust. There is also the issue that powers may be a curse rather then a blessing e.g. Rogue and Cyclops. There are also a number of characters and fractions which would have made the film difficult to make because there would have been no way to make the fans 100% happy.<br /><br />The plot of the film is in the world they are mutants, people with powers that can range from being psychic to changing your apparent to healing to controlling the weather. They are met with fear from the general public and they are calls in the US Senate for the Mutant Regisration Act, to get details of every mutant in the USA. Within the mutant community there are two major factors, the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. The X-Men, led by Charles Xavier, want to have harmonious relations with humanity whilst the Brotherhood, led by Erik Lehnsherr/Magento, believes that the human race would never accept Mutants and that a war is coming. In the middle of this are two mutants, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paqulin). Wolverine can not remember his past and lives a nomadic lifestyle and Rogue is a teenage runaway, who needly kills her boyfriend just by kissing him. Mangento wants Rogue so he can complete his scheme to turn the world's leaders in mutants.<br /><br />This film was not particular action packed; this was because the budget was $75 Million which is nothing special for a summer blockbuster, and the director was Bryan Singer, who's most famous film before was the Usual Suspects, a psychology crime thriller. He chose to focus on character development which was a good move. He also tackled the project as an outsider, he was not a fan of the comics, but I thought that was good because he was able to cut of the flak. He made the film into a realistic sci-fi film which could appeal to the fans and normal movie goers. He made a few jokes about some of the issues of the comics, like the codenames and the costumers. The film does tackles ideas like Wolverine's tortured past and his rivalry with Cyclops, Xavier's friendship with his rival Magneto, the human factor, Wolverine's need to protect children, the list goes on. The film also has a good international cast, Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellon, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden and Anna Paquin. The film also made Hugh Jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an Australian Stage actor and after it he became an A-lister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise. To a lesser extent Rebecca Romjin has also become a major actress.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect, I would have liked to have seen more characters like Gambit and Beast, and the film did ignore Wolverine's and Sabretooth's hatred for each other and the fact that they have a past together. X-Men was an introduce to the film franchise, especially to people who do not know the comics.<br /><br />X-Men is a very good film, X-Men 2 is even better and X-Men 3 was one of my most biggest film disappointments. I would love to see Bryan Singer back in the director's chair and ignore the third film and do it the way he wants and the fans want.",Visual Effect,Plot,
"Set in the late 1920s, this totally charming comedy alludes to many other films, sometimes subtly and sometimes obviously. A Gilbert and Sullivan mood is set up quickly and the film proceeds to a typical Gilbert and Sullivan ending. A young English lady, Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale), was recently orphaned. Having an allowance of only £156 per year and no interest in work, she moves in with poor, depressed relatives. The family are convinced that there is a curse on them and their belief is self-fulfilling. The dwellers on the farm are similar to the Addams family without the humour. Flora's manipulations and positive thinking, change all of their lives for the better. This is a very charming and funny movie, with the fun being driven by exaggeration and positive change.

It is declared for instance that a patient who would need a liver transplantation could be healed by sex therapy given by Johanna. I can not imagine what could be in the brain of the director.

"Oh, what high expectations I had. Fifteen minutes into this, I knew I was in for an exceptionally long two hours. I, personally, have researched as much as I possibly could on the case long before the movie came out...and the only thing that actually lived up to true drama of the real events was the crime scene. It was very accurate...but that's all that is going for this film. Throughout, you simply become bored to tears. Most of the time, I was left confused and often amused by the overacting. There are still parts that I can't understand or don't see the significance. The film did not GO anywhere up until the very end, and even the dramatic parts weren't very exciting. This movie had nothing to draw you in, and by the end it leaves one feeling unsatisfied. The Black Dahlia definitely could have been done so much better then it was, it was all just a jumbled mess.",Visual Effect,Plot,
"Some cinephiles give praise at the altar of Hitchock; others worship Kubrick or Scorsese. Personally, I'm a David Fincher fan, and see him picking up where they left off. Easily one of the most distinctive and talented young directors to come out of the 1990s, he still remains something of a 'cult' filmmaker, in spite of the $100-million box office take of ""Seven,"" possibly the best, most intelligent serial-killer thriller ever unleashed on unassuming film patrons.<br /><br />What Fincher pulls off--and pulls off brilliantly--is a straight-faced, serious approach to a concept that could have easily devolved into camp or slasher-flick excess. On initial glance, the notion of a serial killer who picks his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins seems like the type of tongue-in-cheek fodder for a low-budget '70s or '80s exploitation item; even the tag line (""Seven Deadly Sins--Seven Ways to Die"") sets the tone for a straightforward, mainstream thriller.<br /><br />What a surprise, then, that ""Seven"" is the type of smart, suspenseful, brilliantly-designed and -acted thriller that is nearly one-of-a-kind (""The Silence of the Lambs"" follows close behind). Even more surprising is how the film stormed into the public imagination after ""Alien3"" (1992), Fincher's sour--and quickly forgotten--directorial debut. I hadn't seen a former music-video director operate with such authority in the realm of mainstream cinema (and, come to think of it, I haven't seen one since). Nor have I seen a director take as many commercially-averse risks within such a short career--""Fight Club"" (1999), despite a short theatrical run and polarized reviews, has become to young-adults of today what ""Easy Rider"" was to the Flower Children in '69.<br /><br />Granted, the amount of respect I've given ""Seven"" has fluctuated over the years, and it seems that only now do I see it as being a near-flawless masterpiece. At 15 years of age, it was just a cool-looking 'horror' film--I couldn't latch on to Morgan Freeman's dialog, and found Brad Pitt's cocky go-getter to be more easily relatable; at 25 years, the deeply-entrenched realism of the script, mixed with Fincher's grimy, urban-life-as-Hell visuals and the jaw-dropping performances (not just from the principals--when was the last time you saw notorious scenery chewer R. Lee Ermey in a small yet serious role?). While Brad Pitt's performance might inspire hoots of derision from some, he is actually pitch-perfect as the young, idealistic Detective Mills--this isn't Brad mugging the camera with his good looks for 2 hours; on the contrary, his counterpoint to Morgan Freeman's worldly, jaded, and cynical Somerset makes the movie. And once the killer is captured, these 3 characters share an entrancing conversation within the confines of an unmarked police car; sure, we get to hear the killer's explanation for his crimes, but it is in the tones and reactions to what is said that the sequence conveys a disturbingly chilling power. (It may seem moot at this juncture, but I will say nothing of the killer's identity, save that it was a choice casting decision that paid off wonderfully.) Even Gwyneth Paltrow, then a fresh-faced, relatively unknown starlet, delivers a small yet poignant performance as Mills' long-suffering wife; her scene in the diner with Morgan Freeman is painful, culminating in advice that seems especially dismal, considering what we've come to expect in the way of Hollywood Happy Endings.<br /><br />Which brings me to one of the most surprising--and refreshing--aspects of ""Seven"": the way in which it relentlessly plays against audience expectation. Like the murderer's motive, this is not a film of happy endings but lessons learned (in the harshest way possible). To those who have seen the film--love it or hate it, that incredibly subtle yet wholly grisly final scene is unforgettable, and truly shows that, contrary to current horror trends, ""less is more"" (notice that all but one murder happens off-screen).<br /><br />While I could gush at even further length about ""Seven,"" I think I've made my fanfare more than clear. It's an introspective, compelling film that manages to mine terror and pathos from those daily transgressions we all view as ""common."" And it established David Fincher as a director of great (and continued) promise. Kudos.",Performance,Others,
"Despite all of the horrific reviews it has received, I went into this film expecting a flawed but entertaining thriller. Nothing could have prepared me for the disaster this film is. The premise is pretty simple; forensic psychologist Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) receives a call saying that he has 88 minutes to live on the day that one of the men he put in jail is sentenced to die. This sloppy, horribly put together plot unfolds onward with bomb threats, exploding cars and suspicious characters every which way and it's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen. The story is just ludicrous containing so many contrived details that I had to fight back the urge to bust into severe laughter. There's an ex-boyfriend that ultimately has nothing to do with the plot, sexual 'tension' with every single woman on screen and for some reason there are a bounty of young, immensely attractive females who want to bang Al Pacino even though he honestly looks like he's about to fall into his coffin throughout the entire film.

When Rocky finally gets accepted into a school and does really well, his Mom and friends give him a massive cheer and applause! Touching stuff. Sam Elliot gives great support as Rocky's mom's fella. Rocky later meets Diana, a beautiful blind girl and romance blossoms.

"In the middle 1950s two film versions of Hugo's best remembered novels appeared and disappeared very quickly in movie houses. This French version of ""Les Miserables"" was one. The other was a French/Italian version of ""Notre-Dame De Paris/The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"". That one starred Anthony Quinn as Quasimodo and Gina Lollabrigida as Esmarelda. Both films were actually quite good, and were the best straight versions of the novels to try to get most of the stories onto the screen. However, both were too long for most audiences, especially this version of Les Miserables. This ran over three hours. As pointed out in the other review that I wrote about the 1935 version of Les Miserables, that film version is the best normal screen length film version. But the performance of Jean Gabin as Jean Valjean in this film is superior to the performance of Fredric March in the same role. I would also note that the performance of Bourvil as Thenardier is the best I've seen (even better than Ian Holm's in the 1978 version). Thenardier is an even slimier villain than Javert is, but Javert's single minded pursuit of Valjean in the novel makes the antics of Thenardier look secondary, and they are usually dismissed in the filmed versions (though not in the musical version). Check out the scene where Thenardier and his goons kidnap Valjean for ransom, and the latter demonstrates how tough he is effectively thwarting the plan. It does not appear in the 1935 version.",Performance,Visual Effect,

"Here's another great contender for my own personal award of ""Most Demented Film I ever watched"", but the least I can say is that it was very interesting. ""The Pschotronic Man"" begins with the longest and most unnerving opening credits ever, but they're quite sinister and atmospheric what with the really creepy music and odd color schemes and everything. This is one of them rare films that already make you feel uncomfortable before it even properly takes off. The slow-paced story introduces Rocky Foscoe; a barber with a few issues that may or may not be caused by the fact that he consumes his own hair shampoos and conditioner lotions. Rocky starts having strange visions, like himself flying around in a car and such similar tomfoolery, and he gradually becomes the world's first and only Psychotronic Man. Basically, this just means that he's an older, fatter and sleazier male version of ""Carrie"" who can inflict stuff only by using his overdeveloped willpower. At first, Rocky doesn't comprehend the powers that have been granted to him and even seeks professional help to make the unbearable headaches go away, but then he gradually learns how to control his skills and use it against the people he doesn't like, like his own wife who's in the way of his love affairs. <br /><br />""The Psychotronic Man"" is overall a pretty cool flick, but sadly director Jack M. Sell wasn't quite sure which narrative tone to maintain. Does this story require a dramatic, mysterious or exploitative tone? Or perhaps a combination of all three? This indecisive behavior leads to an illogical structure and uneven pacing, for example when a moody love-making sequence is immediately followed by an extremely violent murder vision. The film is also slow and uneventful. Especially considering the plot outline, they could have made this into a far more grotesque and trashy cult experiment; even bearing in mind the budgetary restrictions. The overlong chase sequence, for example, is the least spectacular one in the history of cinema. The cars just drive in straight lines and at snail pace, without tricky maneuvers or causing flamboyant accidents. Still, there's some greatness to find in this oddball production, like the creepy sound effects that are frequently repeated, including a church bell chiming and half the tune of Ennio Morricone's classic music for ""Once upon a time in the West"". I bet the composer of this film was the only person who had great fun on set. <br /><br />Bizarre film, to say the least, but it did offer us the collective term for everything in cult, horror and trash cinema that is unique and indescribable.

Yates of Republic Pictures made a deal with John Ford to produce The Quiet Man he first made Ford agree to do one of his cavalry epics with John Wayne because he wanted a surefire moneymaker before taking a chance on The Quiet Man. The cavalry picture was Rio Grande.<br /><br />He must have been talking to the folks at RKO who lost their collective shirts when the public stayed away in droves from The Fugitive. It got great critical acclaim and no box office at all.<br /><br />My guess is that The Fugitive was sold all wrong or was made a year or two too early. If it had been sold as an anti-Communist as opposed to a pro-Catholic film it might have done better in those beginning years of The Cold War.<br /><br />The Fugitive is based on a Graham Greene novel The Power and the Glory and it is about a priest in an unnamed South American country who is a fugitive because of his calling. An anti-clerical government has taken control of the country and they are doing their best to drive the Catholic religion out of the country.<br /><br />Henry Fonda turns in a good sincere performance as the cleric, but he's about as convincingly Latino as Toshiro Mifune. The other members of the cast are well suited for their roles.<br /><br />The best performance in the film is from that chameleon like actor J. Carrol Naish who could play any kind of nationality on the planet. He's the informer who rats out Henry Fonda to the police. Very similar to what Akim Tamiroff did to Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bells Toll and Naish's own performance in another Gary Cooper film, Beau Geste.<br /><br />This was the first of three films Pedro Armendariz did with John Ford in an effort to broaden his appeal beyond Mexican cinema. Dolores Del Rio as his estranged wife was already familiar to American audiences from the silent screen.<br /><br />The original novel by Greene had the priest as somewhat less than true to all his vows. He's a drinker and a womanizer. Del Rio's character is also quite tawdry. And this from Greene who was a well known Catholic lay person. But this Hollywood in the firm grip of The Code so a lot of what Greene wrote had to be softened by Ford for the screen. It lessened the impact of the film.<br /><br />And with the whitewashing of Fonda's character came some rather heavy handed symbolism of Fonda as a Christlike figure.<br /><br />Still The Fugitive might be worth a look for Ford, Greene, and Fonda fans.",Performance,Directional Techniques,

Disney Australia did a great job on this one and I'm really looking forward to more animation in 3D from them.<br /><br />The short stories are full of beautiful animated Christmas spirit. They have a nice humor and they tell you what really is important about Christmas (well, except they don't talk about Jesus Christ). <br /><br />I think this DVD will be part of our every-year-watch-it collection for Christmas times.

"""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" is a delightfully offbeat, inventive comedy I can see again and again, and laugh every time.<br /><br />Mike Myers, in a dual role as the neurotic but romantic Charlie McKenzie and Charlie's cantankerous father, gives the best performance I've seen from him so far (I've yet to see the ""Austin Powers"" movies but I didn't especially care for ""Wayne's World,"" maybe because I couldn't stand Dana Carvey or his character). Nancy Travis is quite good as Harriet, the seemingly perfect girlfriend who's got a secret. The supporting cast also does excellent work, especially Anthony LaPaglia as Charlie's policeman buddy Tony.<br /><br />What makes this movie truly special isn't the principal story line -- the romance-mystery-suspense -- but the many wonderful bits of inspired lunacy/hilarity along the way. Among them: every scene involving the hero's cantankerous dad; Harriet's sister Rose persuading Charlie to stay for breakfast; Phil Hartman's cameo as a very intense tour guide at Alcatraz (this scene gets butchered when the movie is edited for TV, even non-premium cable; make sure you see the uncut version!); Charles Grodin as the surly driver of a vehicle commandeered by a cop; an episode involving a guy who works on the obituary page of a newspaper; the side-splitting scenes between Tony and his precinct captain (a very funny Alan Arkin).

"I've seen this movie compared to Donnie Darko several times, most recently in another comment here on IMDb, however, they're nothing alike. Donnie Darko is a beautiful, thought-provoking film, while this movie just falls flat. It tries so very hard to be deep and depressing, that it ends up almost a parody of itself. The quasi-philosophical mumblings of the main character sound like they where stolen from a manga and none of the characters seem even remotely like actual people.<br /><br />My advice, watch ""The Go-Getter"" instead. It too has a young man who's lost both a parent and his way, it too has Zooey Deschanel, and unlike The Good Life, it has humor and it doesn't try to be something it's not.",Visual Effect,Plot,

"I was introduced to this movie by my niece, who had seen it at her vocational school. She and her friends (about a dozen girls) sat and watched it over and over, and cried their eyes out at the end every time! For a 50 year old movie to have that much impact on a group of modern 15 and 16 year old kids really says something about the quality of its content. It is certainly out-dated in many ways, and shows training techniques that would, no doubt make the ASPCA cringe today. For those of us that grew up in a little less gentile world it brings back memories of how life used to be. The acting in the film is good throughout, the characters are generally believable. If you have ever had the pleasure of interacting with a Basenji, than you will realize that most of what is depicted in the movie concerning the dog is quite plausible. It is one of the best dog movies I have ever seen, and really worth a look (if you can find it).",Performance,Visual Effect,
"This film is a bit strange, it features a futuristic setting on the planet of Venus. Why Venus, I can not really answer that. Seemed like the story could have been set on Earth, but I guess you need the isolation only being on another planet can offer. On the planet of Venus there is a bit of a power struggle going on. Seems like some sort of group wants to take control of the planet. Well oblivious to this are a group of bikers who are racing and not really worried about the dire situation that the planet is going through. That is until the power struggle turns into a war that engulfs the planet and shuts down their track. They are in lock down and unable to leave their homes thanks to a curfew. Well they decide to fight back and go after a tank stationed at their track. They take it out and end up fighting for a group of rebels that are out to stop this take over. The film is at its best before the group joins the rebel force as the story seems better developed during this stage of the film while the part with them being in the rebel group seems rushed. Before you get the coolness of seeing them do their daily lives, the take over, and a nice chase scene involving one of the group. There is also a touching scene involving the main boy and a girl. There is also a reporter who is more important during the first stretch. Not that the second half is all bad, most of the action takes place during this time and the final fight is rather good too. Just needs a bit more development during the second half and this film would have been super success.",Others,,
"El Charro opens up in a fairly interesting way, leading me to believe it was some sort of religious supernatural thriller. However these themes are pushed aside, and not really developed. Later the group of friends run into a creepy Sheriff, who escorts them to bar, filled with assorted weirdos, including a wheel chair bound death metal rocker, suffering from some kind of mental handicap. At this point I'm thinking the film is going to become a Devil's Rejects, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre insane family type of film. No again, they simply leave the bar, and the Sheriff, and his wacky pals are never developed beyond that. Seriously, the writer or somebody has really messed up here, the film is a jumbled mess, and I can't begin to imagine where they went wrong. The film doesn't know what it wants to be, one minute it's going for the intense dramatic angle with a girl coping with the suicide of her sister, the next it features snore inducing stereotypes trying to party, and get laid. Finally by the end, it decides to go the slasher route, but it's far to late. I rate this a two, because I know some of the actors' are better then the material, and there are a couple decent kill scenes in the end, though nothing special. For those of you wondering, there is a brief lesbian shower scene with Tabitha Stevens, but it lasts all of three seconds, and you don't see much of anything. On a side note, Lemmy what were you thinking? You have to stick with Troma man, you were great in Tromeo And Juliet, but this garbage is beneath you.",Plot,Performance,
"Chabrol draws heavily on Hitchcockian themes here, and the end result is a short, succinct interesting French tale that, although not meeting the influencer's fantastic work, this film is a good solid starting point for those wishing to be introduced to Chabrol's work; the similarities to mid 20th century English language suspense movies allow the viewer to become easily immersed in the world created. The plot revolves around Helene, a small-town teacher, played well by Stephane Audren, who is loved by her students, although she does not believe in the concept of true love herself. She, perhaps predictably, finds herself falling in love with a new man in town, the butcher Popal played excellently by Jean Yanne. When a series of murders are committed, Helene begins to suspect Popal, worrying that she is next. Of course, in such films the plot is not that important, and Chabrol establishes this with a variety of set-pieces that combine well if not fantastically.",Others,Performance,

Was there ever a more contemptible or manipulative kids' story than this? Treacly hokum is mixed with melodramatic hysteria, with enough story contrivances to fill up several pictures.

I give it 4 because i love hammer films, if i didn't i'd be giving it a 2.<br /><br />If i was any of the actors in the film i'd be rather ashamed but then again it could be just for the money.

"I wasn't too keen on seeing this because i thought it would be a very kid movie, but i'm glad i did. The actors are good, especially Thomas Sangster (Simon). I just loved him! Emma Thompson can change the slightest turning of her head and a mumbled 'hm' into so many things. It is a very cute story, heartwarming sometimes, thought-provoking other times, and funny the rest of the time. The special effects, i think, were perfect. Just enough to show that it was magic, but it wasn't over done, as in some other 'magical' movies.<br /><br />The only thing i did not like about the movie was the fact that the ending was pretty obvious, but it is very hard to make a fairy tale with a twist ending. We never do find out anything about Nanny McPhee, which is sort of the point, i think. She is just THERE. Doesn't matter why or how.

"In the year 1999 a city-sized extraterrestrial battle cruiser crash lands on Earth, and over the next decade scientists and engineers repair its damage and refit it into a hybrid of human and alien technologies. What the Earth-folks don't realize is that the ship has been tailed by an entire armada of heavily armed space battle cruisers who seek to claim the ship and its secrets for themselves. The aliens, called Zentraedi, are a formidable race of giants who have been bred for warfare, but as they approach their presence triggers a booby trap on the downed space-fortress  called the Macross  that plows through them with a devastating energy weapon. Thinking the Earth fired upon them intentionally, the Zentraedi retaliate, thereby launching Space War I. Realizing that it would probably be a good idea to move the conflict off of the Earth (which has just gotten over a long on-planet war), the captain of the Macross orders the use of the ship's untested ""fold"" system to warp the ship to the dark side of the moon; the warp is initiated, but it brings the small city that had grown around the Macross with it, plus, to the horror of all involved, they find themselves just outside orbit near Pluto (that's what you get for messing around with technology that you don't know how to operate!). And as if that isn't bad enough, the fold system has completely vanished, leaving the ship's crew and the now-rescued inhabitants of the city no alternative but to make their way back home using only conventional engines. And as the Macross crawls back to the Earth, the enemy fleet is not far behind...<br /><br />That's the basic setup, but what makes Macross stand out from the plethora of alien invasion space operas that came before it  most notably the classic Space Battleship Yamato (1974)  is its focus on the human element of its story, becoming in essence a soap opera in sci-fi drag. Nearly every character is in some way flawed, and despite the military experience held by many of them, that experience frequently proves moot in the face of deep space combat and technologies that they simply do not comprehend. The ostensible hero, sixteen-year-old stunt pilot Hikaru Ichijo, comes of age during the course of the narrative and we follow him through every awkward step, tracing his evolution from prodigy civilian airman to ace space-fighter, as well as seeing him swallow his reluctance to kill once he joins the United Nations Space Navy (annoyingly dubbed the ""UN Spacy"" for short). Hikaru's also at the center of a love triangle that sees his emotions split between a cute Chinese girl who ends up going from waitress to pop idol overnight, and his by-the-book career military commanding officer; this triangle is milked for all it's worth and is the primary reason that the series proved so popular with female viewers, along with the romantic trials and tribulations of the rest of the voluminous cast.<br /><br />Another thing that sets the series apart from the cliché template is the pan-cultural scope of the cast. The hero may be Japanese, but the rest of the characters run the ethnic gamut, the bridge crew alone being comprised of a couple of Russians, an American or two, an Italian, and a black chick. This was very refreshing at the time, with the then-most-contemporary multi-cultural cast of characters being found in the various incarnations of Cyborg 009, but each member of that international team was drawn in the most broad of ethnic stereotypes. Not so with Macross, which didn't make a big deal ou t of the characters' ethnicities and saw only the Chinese character standing out because of her frequently-worn Hong Kong-style dresses and hairstyles.<br /><br />And while the show certainly has a contingent of fans who revere it for its space battles and transforming mecha, I have to say that I love it most for starting things off on a footing that allows the viewer to think they know exactly where the story's going to go and then consistently pulling the rug out from under them. The love triangle plays out in a way that sees all three participants change and grow, the B-characters go through some serious drama involving the tragic casualties of war and the possibilities that can blossom between even the most bitter of enemy rivalries (let's hear it for Max and Millia!!!), and even the enemy aliens prove to be far more than just stock evil world-conquerers when their strange and ancient history proves that there really is something to the universal nature of basic ""humanity.""<br /><br />Super Dimension Fortress Macross is easily the most well-crafted and intelligent of the space operas from the 1980's, both in terms of narrative and visual impact, and totally raised the bar on how such material can and should be handled. In fact, the only serialized alien invasion show to come along since that even comes close is Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995), a series that wears its Macross influence on its sleeve but somehow comes up a lot less satisfying. If you can get your hands on the Animeigo boxed sets of the original uncut and subtitled Macross series  avoid the sequels and the not bad Americanized version, Robotech  do yourself the favor and check them out, starting with episode number one because the whole thing's one long story told in thirty-six chapters. Even if you're not an anime fan I urge you to give this stuff a chance. Space operas seldom get any better than this, and Super Dimension Fortress Macross sure as hell beats the three recent Star Wars atrocities.",Plot,Performance,
"Chongkwai(Ray MacDonald) purchases a ""cursed"" book which depicts various methods of seeing and encountering ghosts from the spiritual world. He invites a group of friends from Hong Kong to his home in Thailand and they decide to see if the book can actually perform the tasks it represents. In doing so, one of the group, Kofei(Yu Gu)comes up missing during their forest hide-n-seek game using a cat thanks in part to a ghost who ""masks"" him from them. Haunted by his disappearance, upon returning to Hong Kong, May(Kate Yeung) & Teddy(Bo-lin Chen)begin experiencing ghostly apparitions popping up throughout the city with a grief-stricken April(Isabelle Leong)making a drastic decision in order to find Kofei, for whom she believes is dead. May & Teddy will accept a dangerous mission, entering the spirit world as if dead(..another method in the book is sleeping while dressed in burial clothes)to find Kofei..and April who has become missing as well.<br /><br />The Pang Bros take the franchise into a completely different direction, sacrificing some genuine scares, adopting an almost entirely light-hearted approach to those scary spirits who walk amongst the living. Even the title opening credits are played out in a colorfully jokey manner. But, when the gang play around with the spiritual world, the tone shifts somewhat, but the Pang Brothers always implement some tongue-in-cheek gag that removes the sheer horror of the situation. An example being when Teddy is temporarily taken over by a spirit who has him break-dancing in a contest with a couple of clowns. It's hard to really be scared of an umbrella floating in the air, although May certainly is terrified. Who would've ever thought a basketball could be used as a scare device? And, most of the book's methods of contacting the spirit world are rather silly such as tapping on bowls at Midnight with chopsticks awaiting hungry spirits, or looking between your legs for a spirit. I did love this one developed sub-plot regarding a dead girl who had no idea she was deceased, discovering this only after finding her corpse video-recorded at a crime scene thanks to Teddy's morbid voyeurism;she even tries to stop the camcorder with her hand going through the object. The special effects are impressive. I thought the spirits were creepy enough when they expose themselves. I found the twist at the end regarding May and Teddy's fate rather amusing and it fits in with the overall mood of this film. If you are looking for an Asian terror tale, look elsewhere, because The Bros Pang just weren't in the mood this time around. I think the comedic tone will repel some viewers because the cover of the DVD I rented promised something terrifying. But, to be honest, the first two films were full of such despair and angst, it was refreshing to see the third film a bit more cheerful and playful.",Visual Effect,Others,

"Chuck Jones's 'Stop, Look and Hasten' is one of the greatest installments in the whole Road Runner series. The fifth cartoon in the series, 'Stop, Look and Hasten' brings together all the lessons learned in the first four Road Runner shorts and uses them to create a perfect marriage between the ingredients that make these characters and their antics so popular. It combines the breathless pace of 'Going! Going! Gosh!', the wonderful reaction shots of 'Zipping Along' and the experimental extended chase scenes of 'Beep Beep' to hilarious effect. Even the oft-used gags are executed with such perfection that they breathe new life into the joke. Look to the falling bridge gag for proof. But 'Stop, Look and Hasten' isn't just a classic combination of elements from earlier cartoons. It brings to the Road Runner series a very valuable element; the extended set-up. Previous cartoons had just opened with the Coyote in pursuit of or awaiting the Road Runner. 'Stop, Look and Hasten' adds a slower paced opening in which we see the Coyote wandering slowly through the desert, attempting to eat anything from insects to tin cans. It's a great sequence which gives us a glimpse at the sad existence of the character outside of his pursuit of the Road Runner. These steady opening set-ups would go on to become an important part of later cartoons in the series. 'Stop, Look and Hasten' is simply a cut above most Road Runner cartoons. It has everything down perfectly. There's not a wasted second, a rarity in spot-gag cartoons such as this.",Others,Plot,
"Some animals just lend themselves to horror movies, and as movies such as Tarantula, Kingdom of the Spiders and Arachnophobia have proved; big spiders are one of them. Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo was made for television, so it's probably unfair to expect great things from it; and while the film does have its moments, I really wouldn't add it to the list of films that prove spiders are prime candidates for having horror films made about them. The plot is pretty simplistic, which isn't really surprising considering the television origins and basically focuses on a bunch of tarantulas from South America being released in a town in California. We focus on a small airplane carrying coffee beans that have spent a lot of time in storage. Unbeknown to the crew, these particular beans have become infested with huge spiders that kill some of the crew and cause the plane to crash in the aforementioned Californian town. It's not long before the spiders have got off the plane and begin killing local residents; causing the authorities to take action.<br /><br />Most horror films about spiders have the antagonists with something about them - perhaps they're genetically modified, a new type of spider, absolutely huge or maybe there's just thousands of them - this film doesn't bother with all that, all we get is just a bunch of pretty average looking spiders, and it's really not all that menacing - I constantly wondered why the lead characters didn't just put on a big pair of boots and go round stomping on them all. The film was obviously a pretty cheap production as there is no special effects and the sets are very minimal. Unfortunately it would seem that they couldn't afford to hire someone to write an imaginative screenplay either, as despite some standout moments - there aren't a lot of them, and the main sequence in a warehouse, while well done, is really too silly to take seriously if you take a minute to think about it. The conclusion to the film includes an interesting method of getting rid of the spiders - I have no idea whether or not it would work in real life, but one thing is for sure - a big pair of boots would have worked better and wouldn't have involved so much messing about.

"It was over 20 years ago that I first encountered this small cinematic treasure, on the now-defunct indie KHJ-TV, channel 9 in Los Angeles, but it was not at all by accident. Having been enthralled by the magic that is ""Casablanca"" some years before, I had been seeking out other films like it made by Warner Bros. in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Specifically I was after more work by that classic's storied supporting cast: Paul Henried, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, S.Z. Sakall and Joy Page, among others.<br /><br />""Three Strangers"" gathers two of those and weaves them into a unexpectedly amoral tale of the cost of reversing fortune. Lorre plays a fallen gentleman who fallen into a bottle and thus into some dicey company, while Greenstreet plays a solicitor who's been a tad too speculative with his trust accounts. The underregarded Geraldine Fitzgerald joins them as the mysterious woman who randomly gathers the other two off a London street to see if they'll take a chance on an ancient Chinese proverb coming true.<br /><br />""Three Strangers"" if anything goes ""Casablanca"" and that other Huston/Lorre/Greenstreet classic, ""The Maltese Falcon,"" one better in the world-weariness department, with moral ambiguities and ambivalent characters straight out of films noir made five years later. Unlike those other two films, though, there's little likability to be found in the lead characters' roguishness --- save perhaps for Lorre, who gets redeemed by a ""good"" woman's love at the end.<br /><br />Yet that very fact makes ""Three Strangers"" play out like a much more modern film (like one from the early 1970s, say), rendering it an intriguing admixture of old-style character-driven plotting and contemporary moral waywardness and antiheroism.",Performance,Others,

"For someone who had directed mostly (if not almost all) musicals throughout his career, and indeed made his name on Broadway before winning his Oscar for Cabaret (beating out Coppola for the Godfather no less), Bob Fosse was the last person I would figure directed a film about the iconoclast comedian Lenny Bruce. If I hadn't known it was him directing it, I would've thought someone from France had been given the controls on the script to make it into new. But 'Lenny' was indeed a Broadway play by Julian Barry, and here he makes it into something that works extremely well cinematically, and at the same time has that appeal of the theater, of that rush that comes from seeing someone like Fosse direct or Bruce on stage. It's a script that fiddles with the time-line of a man from mid-twenties to (tragic) death with interviews after the fact, and for anyone who knows the name and work of Lenny Bruce would do well to see this 'version' of his life.<br /><br />As usual, the contribution of Dustin Hoffman to the film's success is incalculable. I have seen some footage of Bruce doing his comedy act through the searing documentary Swear to tell the Truth, but even if you haven't seen any footage of Bruce's act (which I'm sure most who were born in my time have not) you can put total belief in Hoffman's portrayal. One of the tenets of Bruce's life and career was that he would be truthful to himself, or at least would have that urge to find the truth early on (during his pre-beat years of the 50's) and then full-blown in the late 50's and especially early 60's. Hoffman, therefore, is very astute in playing this role, how he could find that sense of total absurdity under all the BS, always questioning. And yet, he was also a likely a man with his share of flaws, and a good chunk of the film is about the relationship between him and Honey, his girlfriend-turned-wife. These scenes show Hoffman in a different key than he plays him in the stand-up scenes, and it's terrific.<br /><br />And also, going back to Fosse, the style is another big factor. The cutting is often startling, skipping along to that jazzy beat that is laid onto the soundtrack (I loved one scene where they show a early 50's party at a 'pad', records being played, grass being rolled, Bruce falling head over heels in a quiet way), and then with the comedy clips especially, we get the best and the worst of what Bruce had to offer, his peak in pointing out things with risqué abandon (and ended up getting him in ridiculous trouble), and downfall into drugs and depression. Every step of the way, it seems, Fosse is keeping up with Hoffman's vitality in this character of Bruce, and while the film provides some laughs, it also works as a serious treatise on what it means to try and have free speech in this country. But the message Bruce wanted to try and get through to the public and to the courts is not what one should focus on completely, and if the film did it would've been a weaker effort. It's strongest as it merges with a full-on character study, as Hoffman and the supporting players (the actress playing Honey Bruce is also very good) put on a certain image of a time and place. One of the best films of 1974.",Others,Directional Techniques,
"""The World's Greatest Athlete"" stars John Amos (""Good Times), Tim Conway (""The Carol Burnett Show""), and Jan-Michael Vincent (""Airwolf""). The plot follows Amos' college sports coach who is down on his luck. His leadership has not produced a winning team for his school; he is under threat of being fired if he doesn't find a way to turn the sports program around. On a vacation to Africa, he and Conway discover Nanuan orphaned Caucasian boy who was the son of missionaries, he was adopted by local villagers. He is a superb athlete, being able to outrun a gazelle. The coach sees his fortunes right in front of himbut Nanu is uninterested in the Western world. So the coach concocts a scheme to trick Nanu into following him to America, where he promptly is enrolled as a student and made a star of the track and field program. Will the coach's deception be revealed? Will Nanu find that he likes America and wants to stay? The under-rated character actor Roscoe Lee Browne plays a witchdoctor in a supporting role. Of curious interest is how the racial subtexts in the film were cleverly handled. By the early 70's, Disney studios was not known for casting African-Americans in prominent rolesthe most obvious exception would be the still-controversial Song of the South. Here, Amos is the ostensible lead, with Conway as the sidekick, instead of vice-versa. In another decade, the Nordic athlete Nanu might have been portrayed as being worshipped as a god by the villagersfortunately the filmmakers bypass outdated notions of the ""white jungle king"" and portray Nanu as a young man satisfied with tribal life.",Plot,Directional Techniques,

"I watched this movie for the first time last night and was completely blown away. I read somewhere that it came from a stage play, and you definitely get the feeling for that. So all of those of you who can't sit through movies like The Big Kahuna or Glengarry Glen Ross because ""nothing happens"", don't bother trying to watch this - you'll be bored. But for those of you who want to watch a movie about something, that will actually deal with it, rather than pander to the lowest common denominator, you might want to give this movie a shot.<br /><br />One reason I liked it so much is that I like a healthy dose of symbolism in my movies, and this movie has it in spades. A lot of the complaints that I've seen about this movie is that the movie never tells us what is keeping these two characters apart. (There may be spoilers ahead.) Well, the answer, it seems to me, is that these characters symbolize men and women in love, not just individual characters. Men are often seeking independence and individuality while women are often looking for reassurance of love. (Yes, those were two big stereotypes, but the reason they are stereotypes is because you see them so often in reality.) And the fact that the two characters go out to interview people on the street about how to stay in relationships, I get the feeling that the movie is trying to broaden its horizon beyond these two characters.<br /><br />The other reason I liked this movie is that it recognizes that real love, that passionate feeling that controls your actions whether you want it to or not, is so intense that it has a tendency to both pull people together and tear them apart. I especially liked the way it brought in the philosophies of Marx, Einstein and Freud to give the movie's ideas context from history, science and psychology.<br /><br />The final thing that caught my attention was the way the the movie tried to make a universal statement about love vs. happiness (because they aren't the same thing), and the best way to make it through this muddled life may not have anything to do with either, even if it is dull. I found the whole thing very fascinating and insightful.<br /><br />And if that hasn't completely scared you off, it is an incredibly funny and touching movie. I laughed as I recognized my own reactions to relationships brought to life in front of me. The performances are wonderful. Russell Crowe is one of the best actors working now, and Salma shows that she has a real talent waiting to come out to play. So, if you're still with me and this sounds like something that will appeal to your particular tastes, you might want to give it a chance.",Plot,Performance,

We couldn't understand HALF of what the characters were saying; maybe we'd have been better off if we knew some gansta rap slang, because the conversations made absolutely no sense to us. I mean, we started to wonder if maybe this movie should've been made with subtitles.<br /><br />And if that weren't bad enough, on a purely professional level, ""Juice"" looks like it was shot by amateurs! I mean seriously, just how real are we supposed to take this movie when in one scene (set in a diner, if I recall correctly), the boom mic dips into the picture frame, not once, but twice! Or was it three times? And who was operating it, anyway? It only picked up one half of a conversation between two characters in a booth... and they were sitting right next to each other! We heard one guy just fine; the other sounded like he was mumbling. This was the point when Tommy and I were laughing at it so hard, we shut the movie off, and immediately drove back to the video store to see about getting a refund.<br /><br />If you know ANYTHING at all about film, then STAY AWAY from ""Juice""! I'm far from being an expert, but I know enough to state that in my opinion, ""Juice"" is nothing short of putrid.",Plot,Performance,Others

"Spoilers<br /><br />SILENT SCREAM ain't much of a movie. I call it a micro-movie because the cast is populated by a few actors. There's only one setting. It takes place entirely inside a big but cramped house, and a lot of the action during the climax occurs in the attic. And the body count (aside from the killers' deaths) is only 2! Yep, 2. That has got to be the lowest body count for a slasher in horror movie history. To make things even more underwhelming, the murder scenes for those two aren't very good. What's really funny is as low as the body count is, the story boasts not 1, not 2 but 3 psychos/potential killers (the mother, the woman played by Barbara Steele and the ""young"" nerdy guy). The flashback is confusing and the film starts with, get this, the actual end of the movie, which basically shows us dead people lying on the floor.

"The film is telling a story from Turkey in a difficult time slice and place. The time is 1982 and place is Adiyaman from less developed portion of Turkey. Story is using local musicians who are earning their life from night entertainments or from weddings, as a tool to develop around. Scenario is convincing well and many details such as small things, objects, and clothes are perfectly reflecting that time and that place. This is together with the correct dialogs developed between local people and officers, giving a highly realistic atmosphere to the movie. In spite of some accent errors, cast is successful as well.<br /><br />The mood of the film has a spectrum from comedy to tragedy like their life itself.

"I'd love to be able to say I love ""Dodge City"", but to be honest I can't. The film's got a lot going for it -- wisecracking script, bright colour, great music, and moments of sudden shocking darkness amid a generally easy-going plot -- but while it's pretty good, it isn't Errol Flynn's finest hour, and it isn't among the greatest Westerns either. Enjoy -- yes; love -- no.<br /><br />This was Flynn's first Western, and he doesn't really look at home among the grizzled cast: he's too fair-skinned for that weatherbeaten crew, too well-groomed in a world of straggly facial hair (the trademark Flynn pencil moustache isn't really appropriate here), too neatly dressed to fit in with the rest of the town, and a somewhat self-conscious grin has a tendency to turn up at inappropriate moments (as he disclaims the role of Sheriff, for example), suggesting that he was not entirely certain of himself in the part. A whole-hearted flashing smile is in evidence for the comedy scenes, on the other hand, which are probably the film's strong point: a quality script is matched by Flynn's own natural aptitude for mischief, and by a transparently genuine bond between him, Alan Hale and Guinn Williams as a cheerful scene-stealing threesome.<br /><br />Considered as a Western, ""Dodge City"" is admittedly a ripe collection of clichés, from the gold spike driven into the final sleeper to the cattle stampede, the villain threatening the crusading journalist, the lynch mob at the jail, the dance-hall queen, the poker game, the corrupt saloon owner, the horses galloping alongside the speeding train, the men clambering over its roof... the list goes on and on, with very little original in it save -- oddly enough -- for the involvement of Abigail Irving. The tragedy at the beginning that antagonises de Havilland's character from Flynn's is not out of the standard wagon train story, and the sequences where Abbie finds herself employment as a columnist in a newspaper office -- to the disapproval of Wade, of her uncle, and everyone else -- are among the most striking in the film.<br /><br />It's odd, because this picture isn't an especially good vehicle for Olivia de Havilland; her character is completely wasted during the final showdown (despite being the only one to notice what is going on, she is used simply as a liability to the men), she has relatively little screen-time compared to the male trio, and with the exception of the newspaper-office scenes, the character has little to do save look pretty. It is to Miss de Havilland's credit that she manages to make as much of it as she does.<br /><br />""Dodge City"" doesn't boast a particularly complicated morality, a particularly nail-biting plot or a particularly rich set of characterisations. For all its Technicolor and A-list casting, it's at heart a B-movie writ large, from the era when Saturday-morning horse opera serials were standard fare and big-budget Westerns were just taking off: the next thirty years would produce some classics of the genre, but this isn't one of them. It's amiable enough, but Errol Flynn never looks quite right under a cowboy hat, and the part isn't really tailored to his strengths -- he and de Havilland would do better in their final 'Western' picture together, ""They Died with their Boots On"", as the arrogant, talented, colourful and insubordinate General Custer and Libby, his strong-minded wife.<br /><br />To the viewer who likes Westerns, this is a glossy and entertaining example; to the viewer who likes Flynn, there is a sufficient dose of humour and romance. But I have to admit that this particular film probably isn't going to win over converts from those not already that way inclined.",Visual Effect,Performance,Others

"Clint Eastwood's third coming as Detective Harry Callahan is once again a stylish, well-made, fast-paced and wonderfully strong police thriller that's definitely worth a watch or ten. Personally I've seen it numerous times but I guess when you love something as much as I love Clint and his works you're probably stuck with it. I do admit ""The Enforcer"" may not be the best sequel to ""Dirty Harry"" but it sure as hell is, like Callahan himself would put it: marvelous. Of course Harry says it when he wants to be sarcastic and I really mean it. Tyne Daly played Kate Moore, Harry's lady partner who had no street experience of the real police work. Late Albert Popwell had a different role in all of Dirty Harry flicks except the last one. He was the unlucky bank robber in the first movie and pimp in the second. This time he played Ed Mustapha.<br /><br />""The Enforcer"" also included an uncredited cameo of Joe Spano who few years later got an excellent part of Henry Goldblume in the magnificent television series ""Hill Street Blues"". And let's not forget that Harry's Magnum .44 is one of the most important characters of the film. Plot is average and not as inventive and interesting as it was in ""Magnum Force"" but this movie contains perhaps more humor than any other part of the series and at least two of my favorite Dirty Harry -moments. Other one is the scene where Harry puts an end to an armed shop robbery and a hostage situation by driving a police car inside the store (very unusual police work and a crazy stunt you can only expect from Callahan) and the other one's when Harry blows away a tower in Alcatraz with a rocket launcher.

"Did I miss something....because the review by NormaDesmond69 must be about a different picture....<br /><br />The main problem here....as is so often the case with 'indie' movies, is that the key creative responsibilities such as producing, writing, directing and playing the lead get filled by one person, the one who had the 'vision' for the movie.... in this scenario the ability for real objectivity becomes lost as that individual is far too close to the project.... the reality with this film is that the story was not strong to begin with and judging from the credits, there appears to be no one adding perspective or any objective input... I would suggest the picture was in trouble before principal photography even begun.<br /><br />Clearly though, James Michael Bobby was the absolute saving grace in what would have been an otherwise dire and unwatchable movie. Contrary to other views, I would argue that he totally pulled his weight and did exactly what his character was supposed to do, be menacing, vulnerable and the catalyst for action at a turning/breaking point in a deeply dull and empty marriage (frankly I would have turned gay had I been married to that dreary, needy woman)...I don't agree with anyone who thought that Gregory Christian delivered anything more than a lack lustre energy-less performance in a highly confusing, self-indulgent, yet ultimately predictable storyline for the genre.<br /><br />In Sunset Boulevard, the 'real' Norma Desmond said, ""We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!"" Sadly in this case NormaDesmond69 seems to have missed the irony that in 'Cowboy Junction' they had neither !",Visual Effect,Directional Techniques,
"I think its a travesty how this movie has taken so much heat compared to the rest of the series. While I love this kind of camp, every character, plot and film in this series has largely been interchangeable with the others.<br /><br />Fast forward to 1993 and we have a film that attempts to add innovations like pop horror references to the films Evil Dead and Nightmare on Elm Street without resorting to half-baked comedy (I'm looking at you Freddy). We have a film that updates Jason's by-now clichéd features to a more sublime grotesque, looking like a serial killer would look if he ignored hygiene for 20 years during his hacking and slashing hayday.<br /><br />The plot makes a marked improvement from ""I know they're all gonna die, but how?"" to ""What the hell could possibly kill Jason? What does the Necronomicon have to do with it (merely a mystery in the mythology)? Jason has family? and We're finally going to get some friggin' resolution here?"" Come on people: Jason X should have been shunned by any self-respecting fan after all the promos claimed this to be ""The Final Friday"". Plus finished it in what I considered to be a climactic finale. Instead you crawled back on your knees like the creatures of habit that you are, always willing to settle for another broken promise and failed expectation from a marketable franchise. Note: Let's be fair though, none of us could have helped wanting to see Freddy Vs. Jason.<br /><br />To the creators of this movie, I give you props.

"This is the first time I decided to write a review. At the time when Cousteau's documentaries aired regularly, I was still a child. Cousteau and the life he led captivated me and evoked in me a sense of adventure-seeking and fascination with the sea. Wes Anderson managed to not only recapture the Cousteau mystique with a twist but to also take me back to this wonderful time.<br /><br />The Life Aquatic is a brilliant and unique work of art with a wonderful cast. The various subplots are beautifully thought out. Those who cannot connect with this film were simply born at the wrong period. Those who cannot appreciate it are simply much too rigid to understand creative movie-making.<br /><br />I truly hope they make a sequel! Afterall, Cousteau is known to have faked some scenes.

"I've never been a fan of the Western genre, but I found myself enjoying this one. This is not your typical Hollywood Western. It cuts out pretty much every romantic vision of the American west that Hollywood has ever portrayed and just presents a fascinating bare bones account of one of the frontier's greatest heroes. Rather than focusing totally on the OK Corral, there is an emphasis on the events prior to Tombstone that molded Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />This is one of the few Western movies I've seen where you get a feel for how it actually might have been to live in that time. Instead of the usual Hollywood fluff, you get something much different. There are still scenes with stagecoaches and saloons, but they don't seem as romanticized as in other Westerns. And you also get other non-Hollywood visions of the West, such as scenes with buffalo being slaughtered and skinned.<br /><br />Wyatt Earp himself is portrayed as a very powerful individual who, while fighting on the side of the law, could also be cold-hearted, cruel, and excessively violent at times. Attributes necessary for survival as a lawman.<br /><br />Costner is fantastic as Wyatt Earp, with one minor complaint. He's got the attitude, posture and look down pat. It's just that I think his voice is a bit too nasally to carry the power that Wyatt Earp must have had whenever he spoke. As for the other actors, they are all outstanding with Dennis Quaid in particular turning in a great performance as Doc Halladay.<br /><br />A lot of people have commented on this movie and Tombstone. Personally, I enjoyed both, but the difference is that when I watch Tombstone, I feel like I just watched an entertaining story, whereas when I watch Wyatt Earp I feel like I just saw a piece of history. Overall, an excellent and very under-appreciated movie.",Visual Effect,Music,Directional Techniques
"There are many redeeming qualities about this movie, and I think it's better than most people are making it out to be. I really hope the idea of a struggle for redemption comes through. It did for me. If it does, then the film, in my view, succeeds in telling the story that it should. I should mention, the opening scene really pulled me in. How could it not, being graphic and striking? Some people might think it was gratuitous. I think it was integral to the story.<br /><br />Element after element, plot event after event set the tone for a story that is being told. I could really appreciate the commentary about the extremes some people may go to (kidnapping) in Mexico. It's not an ordinary topic, and it's treated very well. Very creative. Including the title which I thought was very suitable for the film.<br /><br />Give this a try. It's good if you're in the mood to get a slice of life of Mexico. I think it does just that in a creative and entertaining way!",Performance,Visual Effect,
"Horror films were a major feature of the British cinema in the sixties and early seventies, largely because such matter could not be seen on television, the broadcasting companies regarding it as being unfit for family viewing. ""I Don't Want to Be Born"" (aka ""The Devil Within Her""), clearly shows the influence of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Exorcist"", although the film to which it bears the greatest resemblance, in terms of its story, is ""The Omen"". Yet as it came out in 1975, a year earlier than that movie, it clearly cannot be an ""Omen"" rip-off. Perhaps ""The Omen"" was an ""I Don't Want to be Born"" rip-off.<br /><br />Like ""The Omen"", ""I Don't Want to Be Born"" involves a devilish child with a symbolically significant name. In ""The Omen"" he is called Damien, obviously a play on the word ""demon"". Here he is named Nicholas, presumably a reference to the fact that the Devil is sometimes referred to as ""Old Nick"". (I often wonder how this usage arose, given that Saint Nicholas, aka Father Christmas, is one of the most beloved saints of the Christian Church).<br /><br />Nicholas is the son of Lucy, a former nightclub stripper, and her husband, a wealthy Italian businessman living in London. (At least Lucy is assumed to be a stripper, although from what we see of her act it does not actually involve taking her clothes off. Joan Collins, at this point in her career, seems to have been rather more coy about nudity than she was to be a couple of years later in films like ""The Stud"" and ""The Bitch""). The title refers to the baby's reluctance to come into this world; having been thrust into this vale of tears against his will has obviously had a deleterious effect on young Nicholas's character, as in the first few weeks of his life he proceeds to slaughter everyone who comes near him, including both his parents, his nanny and the doctor who delivered him. The only person who seems able to control him is his aunt, a nun who flies in from Italy to act as exorcist.<br /><br />I was a teenager in the seventies and recall constantly being told by my elders and betters that my generation were all a bunch of hooligans. Numerous explanations were put forward for this supposed epidemic of juvenile delinquency- boredom, youth unemployment, peer pressure, drugs, alcohol and the permissive society- but the cause of Nicholas's bad behaviour seems to be something more exotic, namely a curse placed upon his mother by a lustful dwarf whose sexual advances she rejected. The said dwarf is employed by the nightclub to prance around on stage while the girls are performing, although it is never explained why the club owner assumed that this bizarre diversion would increase the erotic allure of their performances.<br /><br />Although the film contains some well-known British actors of the period, including Donald Pleasence, Eileen Atkins, Caroline Munro and Ralph Bates, none of them bring much conviction to their roles. (Bates seemed to specialise in horror films- he also acted in ""Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde"", and this is referred to when in a hospital scene we hear an announcement for a ""Dr Jekyll"". The family's housekeeper is called Mrs Hyde). Collins looks incredibly glamorous for a woman in her early forties, but nevertheless manages to turn in one of the worst performances of her career, even though she could at times be very effective in horror films like ""Tales from the Crypt"".<br /><br />""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" may have their faults, but they are technically well-made films, well-acted and at their best genuinely scary. ""I Don't Want to Be Born"" is none of those things. It is a the sort of trashy low-budget horror flick, thing that the British film industry could churn out by the dozen and which generally showed that industry at its worst. The one good thing about it is that it came towards the end of the British horror boom. The genre declined in importance in the second half of the decade, largely because the broadcasting authorities were becoming more permissive about violence provided it was shown late at night, and in the eighties the industry, freed of its addiction to horror exploitation movies and silly sex comedies, underwent a revival when it returned to making intelligent and watchable films. ""I Don't Want to Be Born"", however, serves as a reminder of just how bad British cinema could be at its nadir. 3/10",Performance,Others,
"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!! well I had my mind made up for this movie to be just plain horrible, according to the reviews, but since I had no choice but to buy it I did and wasn't REALLY disappointed.<br /><br />I totally agree that the movie isn't really funny as it may seem in the trailer. I mean the fact of making ur rival fat and turning ur friend orange MAY seem funny 'but' they don't crack me up. But there was SOMETHING about it that made me keep watching it.<br /><br />Let me make myself clear, this movie is NOT outstanding in my opinion. There are little things that are really little, but they are very important.<br /><br />Emma (Anne Hathaway)is the quiet and caring, while Liv (Kate Hudson) is aggressive and strong willed. But this experience makes them realize that it's not who the REALLY are. First off Liv has a lot of moral support from her fiancé while Emma doesn't. And at the end of the film we see them as opposites from who they were at the start.<br /><br />It may seem silly but if you watch carefully, you will see what I mean.

"I saw this version as a child, and fell in love with Rochester and with Michael Jayston, whose performance is very winning, witty, and believable. That production introduced me to the book, which I have read many times and loved my whole life. I can't believe I was so young when I saw it, because it made such a deep impression on me and I understood it so clearly, even at a young age. <br /><br />Seeing it again on DVD, some of the early scenes made me laugh because the acting is rather wooden, and the production values are very 1970s. However, when we get to the interaction between Jane and Rochester, it comes alive and I forgot the datedness of the production. The dialogue is straight out of the book, and in some places this makes it unrealistic and cumbersome, but the narration in Jane's voice is wonderful, because it lets us know what she in thinking. Other productions have not done this, and sometimes it's useful to know why she acts as she does. The developing love between Jane and Rochester and the enduring nature of that love is the central theme and that is beautifully done. <br /><br />Sorcha Cusack conveys Jane's determination and intelligence very well, even though she looks too old for the part, and Michael Jayston is the best Rochester ever. This is a must see for Jane Eyre fans!",Performance,Plot,Visual Effect
"This short consists of Al Jolson standing in front of a set designed to look like a plantation home of a slave--and not surprisingly, he performs in black-face. It's on a stage, but I was impressed by the amount of detail on the set, as the background painting was great, the cabin looked real and a live chicken walked about as Jolson sang.<br /><br />It begins with the song ""When the Red, Red Robin comes Bob-Bob-Bobbin Along"" and is followed by ""April Showers"" and ""Rockabye Your Baby With a Dixie Melody"". Between each song Jolson talks a bit and introduces the songs.<br /><br />While people no doubt will be aghast at a minstrel show, it was a widely accepted sort of performance at the time and people just didn't think or care about how harmful such a stereotypical performance could be. It was a product of the times and can't be completely ignored just because it makes people uncomfortable--especially since this is such a super-important film to our film history. This is especially true since this short pre-dates Jolson's performance in the seminal film ""The Jazz Singer"".<br /><br />Technically speaking this is an amazing film. It has exceptionally good sound for such an early film, gorgeous sets and wonderful cinematography and is a must for anyone who considers themselves to be a cinephile.<br /><br />This film, by the way, was included on the first of three disks with the DVD release of ""The Jazz Singer""--a marvelous collection of early talkies as well as documentaries.",Directional Techniques,Others,
"Anyone who thinks this is the best or even one of the best Bond films is in love with Roger Moore or didn't see the other 20 films. It may have been highly regarded when it came out, but compared to the others in the series it is quite weak. Michael Lonsdale had a lot of potential as Drax. Why does he have a English accent? He is German in the book! They could have at least got that right. I liked Jaws more as a murder machine in TSWLM. I do not like Bond in space at all. Lois Chiles is possibly the most boring Bond girl in the series, and such stiff acting! I put this one lower than the Man With The Golden Gun (Christopher Lee was ten times better as a villain than Lonsdale). In the bottom 5 in the series (not the worst mind you, that belongs to Die Another Day or A View To A Kill). This movie may have been quite good if they had stayed close to the book. I doubt Moore could have played Bond though if that happened.",Performance,Plot,Others
"Well, at least this one has closed captions AND DVD captions...if anyone cares! So, the deaf and hard of hearing can also enjoy watching films that are awful piles of dreck! It's interesting that two films in the IMDb Bottom 100 have similar titles. There is SNOWBOARD ACADEMY and SURF SCHOOL--which would apparently indicate that some sort of trend might be occurring. Perhaps there will be a ROLLER BLADE UNIVERSITY or the like coming out in the next few years! <br /><br />When the film begins, it's obvious that writer Joel Silverman had watched a lot of formulaic teen films from the last 25 years. All the characters seem like caricatures. There is the female Japanese exchange student who doesn't speak English (a knockoff of the female French exchange student from BETTER OFF DEAD), the hyper-religious mom and her hyper-square virgin son (straight from CARRIE--but without the insane magic powers), the obligatory black teen (from practically ALL teen movies--and why do they always come in ones?!), the punk rock-ish boy with weird hair (again, from most teen films), the Goth girl who is so obviously 'hot' underneath all that black makeup (but, of course, no one recognizes this) and gear and the very nice AND hot leading man (can't the leading guy NOT be hot for once?!). It's all about as believable as the Tooth Fairy and betrays hack writing.<br /><br />Taylor Negron and Diane Delano play an older couple who are rather repulsive. It's not just that they behave like horny dogs in heat but they are just gross people. Not a particularly pleasant couple and not what any sane person would consider 'comic relief'! There is a chimp on hand as well. Whenever the ape appears, references to bestiality seem to follow. Nice touch, huh?! The appearance of Harland William did not bode well. While he can be funny when he just talks off the cuff on TV, in films he has a very strong propensity to appear in ANYTHING...as long as it's bad. When ROCKETMAN is one of the best movie of his career, you know you're in trouble! The females in the movie, with the exception of the Goth girl, are there for pretty much one thing...sex. They are horny bimbos who have no depth whatsoever or personalities and they are nothing but walking pairs of breasts--which you see quite often. I doubt if N.O.W. would approve.<br /><br />The film is about a group of losers (listed above) who go to Costa Rica a week ahead of their fellow senior class members so they can ski the K-2...no, wait, that's also BETTER OFF DEAD (and about 4523 other teen films). No, they want to learn to surf and out-surf the stuck-up jerks who are graduating with them in only a few weeks. Wow,...now that's an important and worthwhile goal! <br /><br />Overall, there is really nothing to recommend this film. It's unfunny, crude, horribly written and appallingly unlikable. Remarks about body crabs and crotch itching, images of Williams sitting on the toilet taking a dump and, once again, the bestiality references make this one abominably offensive and stupid film. I could only imagine it being of interest to people who are either actively psychotic or under the influence of very, very strong intoxicants. A loser of a film that I couldn't have hated any more. Repellent garbage...at best.<br /><br />Currently, this film is ranked #50 on the IMDb Bottom 100 of the worst films ever made.

"Two of the most successful movie musicals adapted from Broadway shows are The Sound Of Music and Cabaret. Of course what could Maria Von Trapp and Sally Bowles possibly have in common, other than the times they live in and how they dealt with them.<br /><br />Cabaret takes place at the tail end of the Weimar Republic era as Sally and her crowd party on while Germany is surrendering its freedom to an authoritarian minded party and its leader. Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles in what is her career screen role. <br /><br />With the fading away of the musical genre, we don't get to see Liza Minnelli too often as a singer so be grateful that Cabaret is recorded and popularly available. Her role also calls for a great actress as well, so small wonder she won an Oscar in 1972 as Best Actress. Her award was one of eight that Cabaret received. <br /><br />Cabaret ran for 1165 performances from 1966 to 1969 on Broadway and it was reversed there in terms of casting. On stage it was an English woman and an American man expatriate it Weimar Berlin and starred Jill Haworth and Bert Convy. Michael York took the role of the rather naive young man who while renting a room, falls in with Liza Minnelli and her hedonistic lifestyle.<br /><br />Repeating his role as the Cabaret emcee is Joel Grey who was the Best Supporting Actor for 1972. I think it would have almost been impossible to do a film version of Cabaret without Grey. He's one fey and evil man who is quite willing to adapt to the new Germany. My guess is he found a boyfriend later on in Ernest Roehm's SA and later paid dear for it, either killed during the Night Of the Long Knives or died in one of the camps.<br /><br />I've always loved the contrast between the Von Trapp family who saw what was coming to Austria and took measures to flee and Sally Bowles who kept on in her words, going like Elsie. York could see what was coming as did many others in her crowd. One can only hope she did eventually.<br /><br />Liza Minnelli's best song was one especially written for the screen version by songwriters John Kander and Fred Ebb. With all the awards Cabaret won, amazingly that Maybe This Time didn't even rate a nomination for Best Original Song. In an era when good film songs were at a premium, that was inexcusable.<br /><br />One other comparison with Sound of Music. The song sung by the young Aryan pure Germans, Tomorrow Belongs To Me is a frightening number. I could see young Rolf who became a Nazi while courting the Von Trapp eldest being part of that.<br /><br />Cabaret is a film guaranteed to last forever, something that will never date and something we always have to be reminded about.",Directional Techniques,Others,

"When I first heard about this film, I didn't have terribly high expectations. I had high hopes, but... that was about it.<br /><br />Still, I made the effort (and yes, going from the Sierras to Phoenix WAS a lot of effort) to see this film. And I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />First, the script. Betsy Morris shines in her first script. Her plot is not overly dramatic. The situations the characters face are all very real. They happen every day, but it's the common quality of their issues that makes them important. As you're watching the film, it's less about watching characters, and more about watching the lives of people you already know, that you see everyday on the street, as they unfold.<br /><br />Second, the cast. Yes, some of the names and faces are very recognizable from the WB/CW. This shouldn't be held against them - because not only did each perform solidly, but they definitely played off each other. I will say, though, that Jensen Ackles stole every scene in which he appeared. His character Priestly is very different from any other character I've seen him play before and is, in a way, a visual representation of many of the film's themes - that people are often not who and what they appear, that they are more than what we assume them to be, and that we need to look beyond the immediate. (The tampon scene and the checkout scene are VERY reminiscent of some of the 80's and 90's comedies.... great!) <br /><br />Third - visuals. I must admit that I saw this film on a digital projector and the image was somewhat murky (I blame the projection on that), but it was still immediately apparent that this film holds a wealth of visual potential. There are a number of shots on location on the California coast that made me ache with homesickness and yet, in others, you feel like you're standing in this familiar town, walking down familiar streets.<br /><br />My one complaint had to do with a scene that I felt was somewhat gratuitous (and those who have seen it probably know exactly which scene I mean), but if that's my only complaint, I think they're doing pretty well.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe this film won't ever be an Oscar contender, but it's solid and entertaining and given some of the schlock coming out of Hollywood of late, I'll take a small, solid film over an overdone, trite ""blockbuster"" any day.",Performance,Directional Techniques,Others
"John Garfield is a fighter taken over ""Body and Soul"" in this 1947 Faustian drama about a man who becomes too heady with success and too greedy, eventually signing on with a crooked fight promoter. Garfield is supported here by Lilli Palmer, Anne Revere, Hazel Brooks, William Conrad, Canada Lee and Lloyd Gough.<br /><br />American filmmakers love boxing movies, and why not? It's a one on one brutal action sport that has inherent in it good drama because of what is at stake for people who most likely came from nothing and used their fists on the street. ""Body and Soul"" is no different in this regard, but it's one of the best of its kind. It also boasts an unusual and exceptionally talented cast.<br /><br />The film is loaded with conflict for Charlie Davis (Garfield) - his mother (Revere) doesn't want him to fight; he's in love with Peg (Palmer) and wants to marry her but is talked into delaying it when he signs on with a new and corrupt promoter, Roberts (Gough). This will be the first of Charlie's concessions and unfortunately not the last. He fights Ben (Lee), but isn't told that the man has a blood clot and he needs to coast through only a few rounds. Instead, he pulverizes Ben, causing further brain damage, and takes him on as a trainer out of guilt. Then he's seduced by a money-hungry babe named Alice (Brooks). And on and on, until Roberts bets against him and orders him to take a dive in the championship fight he's been waiting for. (With all the films done about taking dives, anyone who bets on a fight is nuts.) Something about this movie - maybe it's the theme song, which is one of my favorites - swept me away. It's one of Garfield' most colorful performances, and the beautiful, classy Palmer is a perfect juxtaposition not only to the streetwise Charlie but the trashy Alice.<br /><br />The truly transcendent role and performance is essayed by Canada Lee, a wonderful actor who died too young and had too few opportunities in film. His performance as the volatile, ill Ben was Oscar-worthy. Like Ben Carter in ""Crash Dive,"" the fact that Lee is black does not enter into the script at all, and he is treated as an equal. For all the rotten stereotyping done in films at that time, there were a few scripts that defied it. Lee was blackballed and died, almost literally, of a broken heart in 1952 (the same year that John Garfield died), leaving a legacy of five films and some wonderful stage work, including Orson Welles' all-black Macbeth. He was 45. Cast members Garfield, Lee, Anne Revere, Lloyd Gough, Art Smith, Shimen Ruskin, scriptwriter Abraham Polonsky and producer Bob Roberts would all find themselves blacklisted, and director Rossen would be threatened but admit to being a Communist and name names.<br /><br />Magnificently photographed in black and white by James Wong Howe and with top direction by Robert Rossen, ""Body and Soul"" is an example of how wonderful film can be.",Plot,Music,Directional Techniques

This produces the interesting effect of having someone from the present chatting face to face with a puppet in 1940's Germany. Did they think we wouldn't notice?

"I HATED this movie. It opens with an incredibly gruesome murder scene, then goes on to imply that it's really not so bad to kill someone, as long as you ""have a reason"". Oh, and everyone will forgive you for it afterward, even if you don't show any remorse.<br /><br />The characters' motivations are weak: an entire village falls in love with the hero, although he hardly says two words the entire film. The main female character inexplicably prefers washing old men's hair and making her boss' lunch to being a successful businesswoman in the city. And why is it that the murderer has so little trouble dealing with his own crime? Could it be because he's a psychopath? Probably, but we never find out for sure, because the filmmaker never goes beneath the surface to explore anything. Instead, he constantly changes tone, going from a Bill Forsyth sort of whimsy to inferior attempts at Hitchcockian suspense.<br /><br />Some of the acting is good, but the star of the much better ""Shall We Dance"" gives a wooden performance here.<br /><br />Some of my problems with the movie may have come from cultural differences. The murderer gets only 2 years in prison, according to the subtitles--could that be because the courts of Japan would consider his crime ""justified""? (note--someone snarkily emailed me that it's actually 8 years; I'm not going to watch the movie again to check that fact, but 8 years still doesn't seem like much to me for murder.) The director made some heavyhanded comments about the murderer's sufferings in prison, but I thought the killer got off lightly. Also, I didn't understand the ending of the film--I was hoping it would say something to indicate that the director didn't really support the murder at the beginning, but instead it seemed to me to draw parallels between the victim and the murderer that I didn't think were appropriate.<br /><br />This movie makes me feel angry every time I think of it.

"Ah, memories, sweet memories. I recall pulling into the movie theater parking lot with scant seconds to spare before YOR was to begin. I wanted to see YOR because of its title. It also was the only movie starting when we arrived, to be truthful. YOR was magnificently, superbly bad and one of the worst Italian muscle men films in history. And since this was released in the 1980s, our Italian friends threw in a little STAR WARS shtick in the second half for good measure. Reb ""Captain America"" Brown as Yor is an insult to actors everywhere. The special effects are laughable, on a par with a high school production. Everything you have read elsewhere about this film is true. I still can recall Brown fighting the head -- but not the body -- of a raptor and some bizarre gliding nonsense and a poorly executed laser battle near the end. I have seen some real stinkers in my time, but this one pretty much takes the cake. My wife and I and company snorted and chortled our way through the whole thing, which beat crying. YOR is a must-see for Z-grade film lovers everywhere! Remember those awful sword and sorcery flicks with the guy who played Tarzan in the late 70s? Remember that particular Tarzan flick? YOR is worse. But entertaining in a trashy way.",Plot,Visual Effect,
I wasn't expecting to much from this movie but was pleasantly surprised. Though the plot is a quite far fetched I couldn't help but fall in love with this fairy tale. So often with modern Hollywood comedies the laughs are from base and uninteresting humour. Not so here. The jokes are well thought out and do not challenge ones intelligence. I'm not a prude and the humour here is not prudish. Sometimes very subtle....as when Grant admires Loy's breasts at their meeting in an upscale restaurant. A prime example of a 1940s screen writer slipping one past the Hollywood censors. This movie has no dead spots...no lulls and entertains from beginning to end.,Plot,,
"If anyone is labouring under the misapprehension that Mickey Rooney can act, they will have their belief crushed in this dreadful work. In fact, the only decent acting (amongst the major actors) comes from Lewis Stone, but he looks so out of place with the rest of the cast, that at first you think he's the bad one. Stone's delivery is actually very well timed and delivered with aplomb, but this doesn't match the rest of the cast, and it is initially easier to put the blame on him, rather than the real perpetrators of the poor delivery. Oh yes, I should add that Judy Garland has considerable talents, but none of them are properly exploited in this filmic dross. 1939 was destined to be her best year (Wizard of Oz).<br /><br />The script is dire, and worthy only of an essay written by an average 10 year-old. In fact, it is often worse, and quite confused. For instance, the scene where Rooney is asking Stone for money to buy a car is probably the worst bit of writing I have ever seen on screen. Actually, 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!' positively shines, and becomes worthy of an Oscar in comparison.<br /><br />On a more personal level, I did enjoy the inclusion of the 'Ham Radio' scenes, as it was in its infancy in 1938. I found it interesting to see that all the procedures and conventions had already evolved into much the same form that is still used today. However, I should also add that this does not mean that the actors were up to the task of being convincing during the said scenes. Far from it, in fact.<br /><br />To be fair, the technical values of this film are good, for the time. There are some nice camera angles and the use of light and dark was almost up to 'The Third Man' standard. Unfortunately, the script and acting let it down.<br /><br />I have not seen any of the other Andy Hardy films, so I have no way of comparing them. Now I have seen this one, I am a bit loath to 'dip my toes' in any of the others! Overall, I gave this film a 2/10 rating, but I wonder if that should really have been a 1?

"Let me start off by saying that the book ""Flowers in the Attic"" was absolutely incredible. Perhaps because of how much I enjoyed the book, I absolutely hated the movie. Yes, I mean hated. Abhorred. Despised.<br /><br />First off, the acting was...oooh how do I put this? CRAP! And that's putting it mildly. Victoria Tennant (Mother) was just purely awful. Not a single line portrayed any realism whatsoever. Louise Fletcher (as Grandmother) is normally quite menacing in her roles, but this time, she was absolutely laughable. Perhaps she simply didn't have much to work with. Kristy Swanson (Kathy)...how on EARTH did they choose her? Every single line was over the top, overly dramatic, and just so plain ridiculously delivered it made me wonder if I was watching an Ed Wood film. Umm, yeah, it was that bad. Jeb Stuart Adams (Chris) was, well, ok I suppose. He wasn't *as* bad as the others, but still had his moments of ""Can someone please buy me some acting lessons?"" Thankfully, the children playing the twins had few lines as they were already difficult to deal with WITHOUT words.<br /><br />The screenplay was just downright awful. Now I understand that books cannot always be *perfectly* translated into a movie, but c'mon...FAR TOO MANY changes took place that completely took away from the story itself. Well, at least for those of us that read the book. The dialogue was excrement, to state it lightly.<br /><br />About the only thing this movie had going for it was the setting. The huge mansion and grounds would have been fantastic for the movie had not the rest of it been so darn awful. It's a shame, this really could have been a great one. Unfortunately, it was nothing but a major dud that left little to enjoy.<br /><br />Flowers in the Attic (the movie) earns 2 out of 10 stars (and that's for the ability to pick a great setting).<br /><br />The book, however, earns 10 out of 10 stars and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who loves reading.",Directional Techniques,Others,
"""Garth Marenghi's Darkplace"" is another original and hilarious comedy show that could only have been made in Britain. It shares a lot of its random humour and imaginative story lines with ""The Mighty Boosh"". Appropriately, Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt have guest appearances here, the latter of which steals every single scene he's in. The whole cast is amazing, though. From Matthew Holness as the ridiculously narcissistic title character, Matt Berry (who might be a bit of a one trick pony, but really gives the performances of his life on this show) and the ever so underrated Richard Ayoade, who also directed and co-wrote the whole thing (which kind of makes him the real life Garth Marenghi, come to think of it). You won't see such great bad acting anywhere else.<br /><br />The show makes fun of Stephen King-like horror writers and cheaply made detective-, hospital- and horror-series all at the same time. What comes out is a weird mixture of doctor-cops who run around a cursed hospital with guns trying to deal with all sorts of spooky occurrences and creepy creatures (while having to deal with the burden of daily admin). Garth Marenghi himself calls it ""flat out, balls to the wall-horror"".<br /><br />Every single line, every bad editing cut, every cheap costume is a big laugh. From the music to the hair to the stupid story lines, the show is dead on in its observations of a typical weekly TV series from the late 70's and early 80's.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this kind of humour didn't seem to resonate too well with a mass audience, so another series is rather unlikely. That's too bad, because I'm sure they could have come up with another set of six fantastic episodes. As it is, the show is a hidden gem for those who get it and will become even more of a cult favourite over the next few years.",Plot,Performance,Others
"The story begins in 1999, with an old gangster performed by Malcolm McDowell being advised that Freddie Mays (David Thewlis) would leave jail after thirty years in prison. His mood changes and he recalls 1968, when he was a young punk (performed by Paul Bettany), and he joined Freddie Mays' gang, his envy of his mob boss and his betrayal. The whole story of these two characters is presented slowly, alternating violent and luxury places and action. I liked this movie a lot. I would dare to say that it mixes 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. Paul Bettany has a great performance as a psycho-killer: differently of those sadists in Hollywood movies that make grimaces, the simple look and expression of Paul Bettany is enough to terrify the viewer. The direction is great, and there is one specific scene that I appreciated very much. When Freddie Mays invites Paul Bettany's character to have a drink in a nightclub: Freddie is giving his overcoat to the attendant and the image of Paul Bettany is reflected in the glass of the door exactly over Freddie. The selection of Paul Bettany for this role is perfect, but why not ages him through make-up? Malcolm McDowell looks totally different from Paul Bettany! My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Os Gangsters"" (""The Gangsters"")",Performance,Music,
"Truth be told, I wasn't keen on viewing Eating Out 2 when it played at the Portland Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, mostly because - not to put too fine a point on it - I absolutely abhorred the original and thought it was an coarse, overrated, and excruciatingly dull hunk of vitriolic idiocy. I enjoy sarcasm when it's the icing on the cake, or the dressing on the salad. Unfortunately, the original Eating Out was an assaultive, self-impressed cacophony of alarming pseudo-rape scenes, caustic one-liners, and hateful stereotypes. There was NO cake, NO salad; watching it was like trying to eat a bucket of Caesar dressing with a spoon. However, I had a free pass to see the sequel and my friends were going, so I caved in and brought a flask (just in case the going got rough). Unexpectedly, the going never got rough at all; it was refreshingly good-humored, charming, and well-written. Imagine my surprise.<br /><br />Thankfully, the sequel eschews the off-putting, grand guinol theatrics of the original in favor of a warmer, funnier, more humane approach to comedy. Even characters I hated the first time around were more appealing in this one. And, thankfully, this was no sapfest - the ""funnier, warmer, and more humane"" parts were nicely complemented with snarkiness (COMPLIMENTED, not ""drenched in""). I also found it surprisingly well-paced (due, I'm sure, to the new writer/director who apparently learned a thing or two about tempo and rhythm from years of working as an editor). All in all, a great movie - and certainly more enjoyable than Running with Scissors, an A-list, ""classy"" gay film which bored me to tears the same weekend.",Music,Visual Effect,Others

"A pool hustler becomes a member of a pack of hustlers. He rises to the top, but soon finds himself the monkey in the middle of a match between his boss and a crooked cop. <br /><br />Freddie Prinze Jr. seems to have a string of bad films lately, with such titles like Scooby Doo, Summer Catch and Scooby Doo 2. But one only has to look at his film credits to see that he hasn't been in a really good movie at all. His career ranges from teen slasher flicks to a poor excuse for a video game adaption. It seems with Shooting Gallery Freddie is trying to show that he's serious now, and that he's left his Scooby Doo image behind. Well, Freddie, I got a message for ya, keep dreaming'<br /><br />When I first came across Shooting Gallery, Poolhall Junkies rip-off is what came to my mind, but for the sake of an argument, I gave it a chance. After watching it, I still came to the conclusion that it's a poolhall junkies ripoff and a poorly executed one too. The main character here tries to act as if he's cool and slick, but with Freddi Prinze Jr. as your main catch, he's comes off and nothing more then a pretty face who thinks he can shoot some pool. In the final stages of the film, I wanted to cut my ears off I couldn't stand his ""broken nose"" accent. Ving Rhames makes an appearance. All he does is walk around and chew on alligator feet. He actually does nothing in the film, until the climax when he shoots some pool and a gun. <br /><br />In the film ""Rounders"" Norton has an ace tattooed on his arm, he says that he has an ace up his sleeve, it worked. In ""Shooting Gallery"" they get 8 balls tattooed on their arm, with Rhames on his bald head. It shows that their part of a gang...but it doesn't work. Rhames outfit is comical, you should see it to believe it. The plot is poorly written, and one of those, he was hustling everyone from the start type gigs, completely clichéd. <br /><br />The pool shooting is quite good, not better then what is showcased in ""Poolhall Junkies"" but good nonetheless. Freddie actually shoots some pool here, nice to see that, but it's obvious that the trick shots are done by someone else. I liked the whole switching of the shooting sides that Freddie does near the end though, I thought that was a neat addition. ""Poolhall Junkies"" has Walken and ""Shooting Gallery"" has Macfadyen. Macfadyen is definitely the highlight here as the drunk, druggie, poolhall hustler. He brings some enthusiasm to an otherwise dead cast. It was nice to see some life pumped into this dead film, but it doesn't last long.<br /><br />The poolhall lingo consists of what the director has heard and made up. Which is obvious when you listen to other lines such as ""If I'm Lyin...I'm Dyin."" Some characters names, if you'd like to hear are Paulie the Pawn and Cue Ball Carl. What's with the random words appearing on the screen? Poolhall lingo? Purpose to the script? It was distracting and adds nothing to the experience except confusion and dread.<br /><br />Skip ""Shooting Gallery"" unless you want a headache from poor acting and a clichéd plot. ""Poolhall Junkies"" this is not. Unless you're a massive fan of pool, check out something else.",Directional Techniques,Plot,Performance
"I was surprised to see that Avalanche was produced by Roger Corman of all people. I would think that even the skimpy budget that this film had by Irwin Allen standards was not something Roger Corman was used to dealing with. <br /><br />Corman didn't spend it on big name guest stars for sure. His stars are Rock Hudson and Mia Farrow. Hudson is the Donald Trump like owner of a big state of the art ski lodge which is hosting that weekend some winter sporting events. He's been told like William Holden in The Towering Inferno that the lodge is in a bad place and the snow looks like it's about to come a tumbling down.<br /><br />Tumble down it did during a storm when a plane crashes into the top of a mountain. The Avalanche starts and it buries the whole cast in that white stuff. <br /><br />This is a disaster film made on the cheap, some winter sports footage mixed with real avalanche footage and some cheesy special effects by seventies standards to bind it together. The plot such as it is, is almost non-existent, the characters are never developed in the slightest, so you don't really care about them.<br /><br />I guess the lesson to be learned from Avalanche is for Roger Corman not to try to be Irwin Allen.",Plot,Visual Effect,Others

Horror fans seek something new and different than all this ""Re-imagining crap we keep getting of a lot of classic horror films. Anyway, throughout this movie, I saw a lot of scenes and themes from older, better and classic movies. For example, our ""Killer"" is bacially a phsycopath man who goes around killing teens in twisted and nasty ways. Just like the ""Saw"" series, except the dude is already dead. What the hell? So he is a ghost that is miracurosly alive and in good shape coming back for his so called ""Revenge"" just like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th. Burke is the killer's name and he has the Kruegar/Voorhees/Black Christmas theme to him. Next...we have our ""wonderful"" death scenes. Which are just like Black Christmas with the gouging of the eyes, ripping of the lips and tongue, hanging someone hanging from a string, chopping a girls head off...typical nasty crap. It is also very much Nightmare on Elm Street. The killer appears to his victims after the lights go out and he is able to transform into people's parents and make them re-live their worst nightmare.

"When it comes to horror films, the only tried and true formula that has stood the test of time (besides red food coloring and corn syrup) is the anthology; that is, a combination of stories that form the body of a movie. <br /><br />There had been several British variations of this over the years (""Tales from the Crypt"", ""Asylum"", ""Vault of Horror""), and Hollywood has tried its hand at it as well, with varying degrees of success. It's had its greatest success on TV ('The Twilight Zone', 'Outer Limits', HBO's 'Tales From The Crypt'), and therefore every filmic variation will indeed suffer by the comparison of style and substance to what had been set before.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise, however, that there has indeed been more bad than good horror anthology films. Just look at your video store 'Horror' section. SO many, in fact, that it takes a special something to make even one stand out from the norm.<br /><br />Sometimes it's a matter of attitude (""Tales From the 'Hood""), other times a matter of the talent before and behind the camera (the aforementioned British classics). And then other times still it depends on the energy, desire to entertain and a willingness to admit that there's nothing new under the sun and just crank it all up as loud and as fun as a horror movie can be.<br /><br />To say that ""Death 4 Told"" does nothing new is not news. But for a movie that took less that $90,000 to film and produce and featured a majority of fledgling actors and so forth, it would be difficult to not appreciate the effort put forth. I'm sure this also isn't news to a majority of the people who are reading this.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that as far as anthology movies go, ""Death 4 Told"" does deliver the goods from beginning to end.<br /><br />Since this is an anthology, allow me to describe each segment as ambiguously as possible:<br /><br />1) A DOLL'S HOUSE - A young writer (Brian Cade) and his wife (Britt Marder) move to a small town and rent a beautiful house for him to work in. Secrets abound, however, when footsteps and a child's laughter are heard within. This is only compounded when Pete (ME: George Litman!), a crazy local, asks a cryptic question: 'Have ya met Toby yet?'<br /><br />2) FOLKLORE - A group of college friends set out for the woods when the driver Travis (Nar Williams) runs over a strange wolf-like animal. Soon, the group finds themselves beset by strange sounds deep in the woods, rustling bushes and glowing white eyes that lie in wait in the dark night.<br /><br />3) WORLD'S MOST HAUNTED - A young intern (Stasia Andrews) on a reality TV show helps set up an abandoned asylum for a broadcast along with the director (Harley Kaplan), technician (Mark Van Fossen) and soundman (Michael Evanichko). But after she finds some unknown secrets on the building's history, its evil history comes to hideous light.<br /><br />4) THE PSYCHIC - Hypocritical psychic Madame Baudeau (Margot Kidder) begins to find her predictions are finally coming true. Unfortunately, the future she forsees is all tragic. Will the next person she reads for live or die?<br /><br />Again, nothing here is terribly original story-wise. That's not the point here. The point is that the directors (Bo Buckley, Michael Close) set the mood early on; messy and chaotic but with huge dollops of humor (much of it self-referential to those who are familiar with the genre); the actors, big and small, put everything they have into their parts.<br /><br />It's all in the tone - fun, of course, but a suspension of belief is still necessary for any movie to work. That's true here; not to mention an appreciation for the general scenes you see in any b-movie: the scary legends, the dark shadows, the unexplained noises, the sinister locals, the sudden splashes of blood, the gratuitous displays of skin.<br /><br />God bless independent horror films.<br /><br />Ten stars out of ten.

"Another mafia movie out of the RGV factory. First of all, set expectations right to enjoy the movie. Don't expect the brilliance of Satya, raciness of Company, or the impact of Ab Tak Chappan. Then you will end up actually enjoying the movie instead of panning it as just another mafia movie.<br /><br />I am surprised that they didn't promote this movie as the prequel to Company. Hollywood would have milked the angle. Hindi movies need to start doing it. But it is a ""prequel"" to Company, no questions about that. When seen in that angle you understand the motivation behind making the film.<br /><br />The biggest plus of the movie, like other RGV movies there is no sugar coating. The scene where Deshu is sitting and eating lunch in the chawl is so realistic of chawls in B'bay that you almost can touch and smell it. There is no Yash Chopra grandeur. The romance is gritty and real. There isn't too much dialogue in the movie which furthers the impact. There is no real need for it, you can extrapolate the dialogue from the situations. The background music is fitting. Another plus point of the movie is the focus on the story. The movie never veers from it. The story is about the rise of common man to that of a mafia don (Deshu). There aren't any sub plots to divert the attention of the viewer. The acting for most part is top notch. Rukshar (Bhakti Bhatnagar) who plays Deshu's girlfriend is the only one who doesn't command a screen presence.<br /><br />So whats the biggest minus ?

The deaths are some sick stuff - yet MGM showed it with a 16 rating! There is no way this was made in 1991. I guess this sat on the shelf for at least 5 years. This is pure early to mid 80s. All grey-flecked suits, rolled up sleeves, wide shoulder pads, permed mullets, grey marble, clashing pastels, and bright neon tube lighting.

Some father and mother you barely even remember the names of, some random ""hot"" sister and a boyfriend I completely forgot about until now (just thrown in to keep her out of the way) and a dork of a son. It all starts out with the son being hit by a car by stereotypical jocks..err..well they were some stereotype. They move to the country where there were more stereotypical hicks to pick on him. Or something like that. A few characters were randomly thrown in so they could pretend it was intended to make sense (ex. Jamaican, old lady) but I'm not sure why they were really there. Mainly all you heard was choppy, barely audible dialog, then crappy background music blaring in the background while scenes skipped around like the west was won. Absolutely made no sense, a storyline overused x 10 (but at least the others made sense). By the end of the movie I still had no clue what was going on. World War Two? Maybe. Apocalypse? Perhaps. Brain-Eating Zombies? Well then I might have been interested.<br /><br />Do. Not. Watch.

"A bunch of kids of indeterminate age take a cross country trip to, uh, New Orleans? Because they end up in Asbury Park, NJ. They WERE going to New Orleans, right?

And this particular hulking loony grew up inside this Dark Ride, being that he didn't look right so he was kept hidden.

"This is the first movie Adam Sandler has made since Punch Drunk Love. Punch Drunk Love was one of my favorite movies of the last year, so it will be unfair to compare his past movie with this one. He made a good effort in this movie. His co-star is Jack Nicholson; Who just came off of making the successful About Schmidt.<br /><br />Anger Management is really about the stars. If the same exact story line were made into a movie with unknown actors, it would not have been so commercially successful. That is all right, I enjoy watching Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson practice their craft. Their acting abilities of intensity and humor are what made them so successful. These actors have the ability to turn a stale script into a good movie. I feel that is what they did on this movie. They made it better just by participating in the movie. I enjoyed watching them interact, and watch their chemistry. It is rare, but these stars made the movie good.<br /><br />It was about Adam getting assigned to an anger management class for a falsely accused outburst on an airplane, and he keeps getting falsely accused of anger throughout the movie. His anger management supervisor is Jack. Adam has to pass his program to have charges dropped against him. In the end it all ends up being fake. It was designed with the help of his girlfriend to give Adam a wake up call.

"How fickle film history is! To think that this most intense crime thriller has been totally overlooked. I wouldn't say underrated, because it seems that everyone who has watched it agrees with me.<br /><br />I woke up ten minutes before this movie started on TV, flicked the switch, and thought, OK cool, a James Cagney movie. I wasn't prepared for the roller-coaster plunge through abyssal night. Or the violent way with which the riders carom off into the void. The ending scene is totally classic with dialogue and revelation that pitches the film into the darkest reaches of noir.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is hyped, Cotter (Cagney) hasn't got a bottle of champagne, he's got a jeroboam, he hasn't got a revolver, he's got an automatic, he hasn't got one honey, he's got two, we don't do 100 kilometers per hour, we do 100 miles per hour, and in a car the size of a carnival float. The guy's a total psycho, but not in the Robert Ryan way that turns you against his character, in the Cagney way where it's all like some big game to him.<br /><br />There are a lot of totally mesmerising scenes in this movie. Two stand out just for the sheer exhilaration factor - this is the bit where you coo out loud. When Barbara (Holiday Carleton) throws a pot of coffee at Cotter he says, 'No cream?', so she throws the cream at him, 'No sugar?' so he gets the sugar, and finally 'No cigar?'. I was on the floor. Then there is the scene where Helena (Margaret Dobson) takes him out for a drive in her sporty little number. She takes it up to a hundred to scare him, and then he stamps his foot on hers and takes it to 110 whilst she frantically swerves.<br /><br />Some people have commented on how the framing device of the court-case doesn't work. But for me it's total brutality, the director doesn't waste time with the minutiae of court proceedings, he just uses them to makes plain right from the very start that its all gonna end badly. It's a complete train wreck of a movie, there isn't an honest man in sight, and the casual nature of the violence just shocks you. Cutting kills people like he's taking out the trash, it's just another chore.<br /><br />There's also classic support from Ward Bond, in this movie he always looks like he's gonna screw you up and toss you away. This role stands apart from the usual supporting roles he gets, either buffoonish (Fort Apache), ineffectual (Johnny Guitar), foolishly vigilante (On Dangerous Ground).<br /><br />OK so we got broads with pzazz, we got dialogue to die for, we got utter magnetism from the lead actor (as only Cagney can be), and we've got total, anthracitic, ebonic, pitch-black noir. 11/10",Plot,Performance,
"The songs, including a couple of Sinatra's best, are easily the best part of this movie. But the rest is nearly unwatchable compared with the original, ""Four Daughters.""<br /><br />John Garfield delivered a performance in ""Four Daughters"" that made him an overnight sensation - and deservedly so. His Mickey is a complex character that Garfield absolutely nails with a superbly nuanced performance. Mickey is a pessimist, but he is no brooder. He mucks through life as a rather detached cynic. But his brand of cynicism is not really bitter. Mickey is more resigned than bitter. His persona is the result of circumstances, NOT his innate character. That is what makes his character sympathetic.<br /><br />By contrast, Sinatra carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. He is very self absorbed and bitter. He has none of the devil-may-care insouciance of Garfield. While Garfield evokes sympathy, SInatra evokes pity (at best). There is the possibility that Garfield's character could actually fit into the Tuttle family, given a change of luck. But Sinatra's never will; indeed, he never does. Even while tinkling the ivories in the new happy ending, he still seems like a self- absorbed brooder. His persona is the result of his character not his circumstances. So, when his circumstances improve, his persona is unchanged. The happy ending is a terrible contrivance, but it would have worked much better with Garfield's Mickey than with Sinatra's.<br /><br />Nor did I ever once feel any chemistry between Frank Sinatra and Doris Day that convinced me they truly were a loving couple who I wanted to cheer for. But I did feel that way about John Garfield and Priscilla Lane. There was never such a huge contrast in personality between Garfield and Lane as there was between Sinatra and Day. And I sensed much more chemistry between Garfield and Lane than between Sinatra and Day. The possibilities that seem to be in reach for Garfield and Lane are what makes Mickey's death so tragic. I never sensed those possibilities for Sinatra and Day. Sinatra's death would not have been nearly as tragic. Nor does his survival seem to offer the promise of fulfillment of those possibilities. The gulf between Sinatra's character and Day's character is huge. No mere change of circumstances can change that.<br /><br />In sum, I didn't dislike the Mickey portrayed by Garfield; I didn't like the Mickey portrayed by Sinatra.<br /><br />Finally, the Gig Young character in this remake is absolutely superfluous to the new story. Why even bother with him? Just have Sinatra be the guy who comes to stay with the Tuttles in the first place.",Others,,
"Cary Grant and Irene Dunne were great together, and though ""My Favorite Wife"" is not as funny as ""The Awful Truth,"" it's still pretty good. Ellen, lost at sea and presumed dead, returns after 7 years to find her husband Nick has remarried. She goes to his honeymoon hotel, which is a setup for one of Grant's best bits - he sees her as the elevator is closing and his head follows the door until it closes. However, he can't seem to tell his bride Bianca (Gail Patrick). Then he finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on the island but spent the 7 years with one Stephen Burkett. In another funny scene, Ellen gets a sheepish, short, bald shoe salesman to pose as Burkett. Nick has tracked the real Burkett down, and Stephen looks a lot more like Randolph Scott than the shoe salesman. In fact, he's played by Randolph Scott.<br /><br />Grant is his usual riot and extremely handsome. He spends a lot of time talking to himself as he acts out what he's going to say to Bianca. Also, as in ""Bringing Up Baby"" and ""I Was a Male War Bride,"" he gets to do something with women's clothing - this time standing in front a mirror and trying to figure out what to bring Ellen to wear. Dunne is very funny, posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca, and also is quite touching when she first sees her children.<br /><br />The only problem is that it all gets a little tired, particularly at the end with a prolonged scene having to do with Grant in the attic. As others have pointed out, the script has some holes, particularly the fact that a woman returning after 7 years gets no publicity. And poor Bianca comes off like a villain when she's a victim. Go figure. As amusing as ""My Favorite Wife"" is, it could have been better.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with these stars, it's a delightful film, and some of the funniest scenes take place in the courtroom.

Whether it was the directing or the wonderful screen presence of the actors, somethng about this film had the ability to capture the emotions of the viewer. I can say that having been used to watching generally Hindi films, february14 is a romance that stands out from the typical Hollywood love story -- paying attention to detail and character development in a way in which I've rarely seen before. Although I was quite new to Indian ""musical numbers"" in which they incorporate within their films and even found the performances in them a little bit on the cheesy side, I throroughly enjoyed some of the songs as well. Great melodies, especially the title song'un peyar ennada' -- which added to the emotional impact of the movie itself. I wll definitely be looking out for more Indian films in the future.",Others,,
"This is a modern version of a 1970s sleazy exploitation movie. Somebody went and got all the satanic talismans, upside-down crosses, lots of candles, and the kind of satanic nick-nacks that you can find at a Flea Market, novelty shops, or occult book store. <br /><br />What is up with the candles? There must have been a clearance sale on candles when the Special Effects department went shopping. Every time I see one of those movies were a scene has hundreds of candles lit, I wonder how uncomfortable was it for the actors and film crew? So many candles even on a film set must give off a lot of heat. Has anyone ever met a person (or cult) who really lights up their house with hundreds of candles?

This movie is boring except when the really cute young ladies are prancing about, especially if you are viewing the film without the censorship-fuzzies. If you watch the TV version, then this movie is very very boring because all you can see are bouncing fuzzies. <br /><br />The plot is that a bunch of marginal youths who are into drugs and drug dealing get stuck in a satanic cult's land when their vehicle breaks down. They are captured by the cow-cult and scheduled to be sacrificed to the cow-god or something.

"Stylistically, the _noirs did much for imposing an aura of machismo and coolness. In this sense, they worked for promoting an appearancenot for deconstructing, but for creating a _legendry of machismo and coolness. Payne is rather cool, as the lead. The movie is supple and deliberately suspenseful. The cast is a very good one. The film acquires, achieves a certain narrative depth.<br /><br />The pace is worthy of a noir's master. After an ingenious robbery, an excon is framed ,then released; he decides he has earned a share and is willing to obtain it. The film is violent and stylistically ambitious. The ultracool approach, deliberately stylish and classic within the genre's canons and in a highly aware mode, is sustained by an able cast. KCC may be seen as a lesson of noir, as a core film, and as a rehabilitation of the genre into the class of the adventurous thrillers (rather than the cheaply philosophical fatalism).<br /><br />It has a considerable, significant dramatic energy and elastic vigor that might remind one of Welles' _noirs, but on a small scale, with humbler means, and also smaller ends, with a compelling dynamism and concision, explicit this time, but without Welles' inventive subtlety and hazy perspectives. With KCC, these seem _pastiched or quite borrowed (yet they are still functional and did not get the _movieish character of later pastiches that are merely laboratory abstract products)but then again, such the things were the good of a whole era in cinema . As it is ,KCC is a fine dynamic adventure moviea thriller. If in Welles' _noirs the economy was like hidden and secret, in ""Kansas "" it is explicit and open.<br /><br />KANSAS  has some of the ingredients of the noir (it is a rather pleasant surprise not to have a standard femme fatal); yet on the other hand, it seems a bit too selfaware, selfconscientious as a cool noirin a way that better movies (like DOA and SUDDENLY) are not. It's coolness is a bit too obvious and rather overstated. Yet KANSAS  is all the way an interesting, nononsense film.<br /><br />The noir is a huge umbrella, encompassing, covering many and various things ,from the bleak, grizzly fatalism to the adventurous, suspenseful thriller to comic books approaches and to the mere police procedural; it refers to a historical cultural phenomenon that began before it is generally acknowledged that it did, and ended later than it is generally admitted.<br /><br />The _noirs' flaw is often the monotony, the poverty of ideas; here again, a vast spectrum is between the intimidating inventiveness and creativity of the greatest (Welles, Wilder, films such as DOAthe _noirs of the most striking originality) that may make a film a thing of many joys, and the dire disappointing monotony of others that have but one note to play. In this important respect, ""Kansas "" is certainly way above the average.<br /><br />Nor the fatalism, neither the coolness and machismo typical of the _noirs had their origins here. They both came from the wide popular culture of the epoch between the warsincluding the hats and images. They were widely defining of the ancient cinematographic tradition that took shape in times of transition and ample changes in society. The fatalism and the macho and the cool tough guy came all from the popular culture and were not inventions of the noir.<br /><br />The core of most of the _noirs is a naive popular aspiration of both telling sincerely what is perceived as the truth about destiny, life, marriage, society, etc. (that is, a tendency towards sincerity and immediacy), and of creating mythical or at least legendary representations of fatalist machismo and coolness, in a cheap and tooexplicit way. This double aspiration is contradictory in itself. These people want to say/intend to say the truth about many things, yet they end up in worshiping fake, phony images of wholly imaginary persons. The people can not afford to be radically sincere, naturalistic ,wholly realist; it always resorts to some kind of (illusory, cheap, silly) compensation that sometimes ends up by taking up the whole intended denunciation. The denunciation of the evils in society and people took the form of a creation of arbitrary images of men and women. The common lies were thereby replaced by more convenient ones.",Plot,Others,

The acting, while amateurish, actually works for the story that the movie presents. The scenario of the road trip is a comfortable one for movie watchers, and it works here. I think what I liked the best about the movie, though, is that it leads you to believe that it's going to end in a violent way and ends up not doing so.

"Having enjoyed ""She's All That"" a sweet teenage romantic comedy, I had high hopes for ""Down To You."" These hopes were dashed about five minutes into the movie. There is little plot and less character development in this film. (Having your main character want to be a chef does not flesh out his character). The dialogue was inane and insipid, the situations completely unbelievable--particularly the pornography subplot, which I can only imagine was meant to be quirky, but fell very flat. The film ends with the two lead characters--right out of college--in professional, well-paying jobs, living in an extremely well furnished apartment--they look like little kids playing dress up. Besides this, the film was boring. The best moment of the film had Henry Winkler throwing a bit of raw salmon onto a table behind him in a sushi restaurant--the only spontaneous, fresh incident of the film.

The character Kyle needs to be sympathetic, but has to deliver too many cheesy one liners and throw so many little drama fits that the plot hardly justifies.

The depiction of relationships, friendships, and actions of the human heart and condition are realistic, unflinching and uncompromising. Each scene that involves the ""Jerk Magnet"" Jamie, (Marguerite Moreau) and her two men, (Naveen Andrews, the hot Persian from ""Lost"" on ABC, and aka ""Kip"" in ""The English Patient"", Juliette Binoche's hot Indian stud); and Bryan F.O'Bryne as the lovable talk show host are all equally heartbreaking, warm, and humorous, ultimately human. The love scenes are very realistic, and uncomfortable to watch, truly making the viewer forced into seeing that sex and intimate acts in the bedroom are truly personal and uncompromising, unlike the mundane and choreographed love scenes we see in films like ""Basic Instinct"", ""Color of Night"" or ""Body Heat"". We see sex as it truly is, imperfect, but at the same time an emotional and physical need that everyone craves. Don't miss seeing a comedy-drama that is truly realistic.",Visual Effect,Directional Techniques,
"An absolute classic. These three words describe this masterpiece. De Palma and his supreme cast give us what we want. An intense drama about good and bad. A towering performance by Connery as an Irish-American cop with a Scottish accent stand out but Costner, De Niro and the rest of the cast, down to the baby in the Potemkin inspired scene at the train station, deliver great performances. Another reason for loving this movie is, that it is full of really bad editing mistakes. The best one being the roof top scene, where Ness helps Niiti to his car.

"What happens when you go to the cinema to watch ""Just My Luck"" but it is sold out, and so is ""RV"" and ""United 93"", and ""The Ant Bully"" and, believe it or not, ""Curious George"" where films you could see earlier? You end up watching ""The I Inside"". I don't want to write about this movie I don't want to write about this movie. With a lot (a lot) of delay, ""The I Inside"" has arrived to our cinema theaters.<br /><br />What on earth went wrong here? I can do some research and find the answer, although if isn't worth the space of my page. Roland Suso Richter, a German director, came to try in Hollywood and directed this picture. He's too stylish for what the viewer is used to see. He invents too much and ends up confusing him (although that's in part fault of the screenplay). What happened to him? He is directing TV in Germany and Hollywood hasn't looked for him in three years.<br /><br />Writer Michael CooneyIs this the same guy that wrote ""Identity""? Is it possible for him to write such a mess as ""The I Inside""? Apparently it is, and if you want to save him you could forgive him because the screenplay was adapted from his own play, and as I have said before, a play can be good but it doesn't have to make a good movie. Joined by Timothy Scott Bogart, Cooney takes you inside the world of a man who is able to change the future by changing the past.<br /><br />I mean, of course the material they had in their hands was interesting; it could have created a cult classic or something everyone would have talked about. But that's not how it went down, and if you try to understand the film, you will get to the bottom of it. There is an explanation; but you're so tired by the time it arrives that you don't want to figure out anything.<br /><br />Tiring is one of the best words to define ""The I Inside""; and it is impossible not to compare it with ""The Butterfly Effect"", a film where you don't want to get to the end. You've got to compare then because the first one sucks and the latter one is great; because the cast of the first one is way superior to the latter one's <br /><br />I like Ryan Phillippe is a starring role: I liked ""Cruel Intentions"" and very much liked ""Antitrust"". But how can an actor like him not carry a film like this one? How can Ashton Kutcher do it better? Sarah Polley is much more talented than Amy Smart, but the same situation occurred. And Robert Sean Leonard; he is better than the whole 'Butterfly' cast put togetherAnd Stephen Rea: he is an Oscar Nominated actor; please! <br /><br />You can also find Piper Perabo in ""The I Inside"" but I doubt you'll be interested after all I've said. Forgive me if I'm to harsh, but there are few movies as bad as this oneIt's the truth.",Performance,Visual Effect,
"One day a middle-aged architect of Paris suddenly cuts off his mustache, but his surrounding claim he has never had one. Somebody is wrong, and since nobody shares his opinion, he has to escape to Hongkong from the forced mental treatment. Here, in the meantime, he cuts again his regrown mustache, and because this time the change was recognized by his wife, they, again, find each other. What is this film all about? Perhaps about the importance of the everyday matters of no significance, which can still, somehow, ruin our life. About whether we really know each other, listen to each other or even our closest relationships are superficial? Or are we a witness of a disintegration of an instable personality? There is a short-story with the same title Moustache"" written by the French novelist, Maupassant in 1883, which can elucidate a different way of interpretation. The story is a real ode to the mustache by a fictitious lady. But one can read about other interesting things in that letter  And mainly I adore mustache because it is French, pure-blooded French wear. We inherited it from our Gallic ancestors, and deserve it, like the symbol of our national character."" From this point, the saucy mustache of our hero becomes the last symbol of a national identity. He and his wife live a life of a typical citizen of a Western world in the multicultural Paris. They prefer sushi to French food, travel Bali for holiday, and buy Chinese dresses and trinkets in Hongkong. His close surrounding, his wife and his friends, do not even notice the change caused by the disappearance of his mustache, but from an objective point of view (policewoman) the difference is obvious. The past is coming to an end, which is presented by the death of his father, and the vain search of the house of his childhood. This necessarily leads to the development of a split personality: is it himself who is insane or the others? Is he a victim of a conspiracy, or is he suffer from persecution mania? The never-ending ferry-boat journey between two coasts representing a loss of his footing, and the spin of the drum of a washing machine in his dream (head) becomes a symbol of a brainwash. This film is a story about a man who has lost his national identity, and if there is a chance to get it back. There is no answer but perhaps he has to travel to the other part of the world to make even his wife understand; yes there is something what we have lost, but it is good as it is. Still, the last picture is quite worrying: a man without a mustache is lying in a dark sleeplessness, like in a grave.",Directional Techniques,Others,
"""Shanghai Triad"" tells the story of a young country boy who takes a job as a servant to a mob boss in Shanghai and becomes a passive observer to the skulduggery behind Shanghai's opium wars.

"This is personally my favorite film. However, I can understand why this one-time sci-fi/horror flick views more like a comedy today. The film has dated more than other films from '71/72, and with the special effects bar haven risen astronomically since that time there is little hope for the film to grow even older gracefully. And a shirtless, oily, middle-aged, often over-acting Charlton Heston doesn't exactly shout hero or Academy Award. But THE OMEGA MAN has its moments, in particular its unexpected, and unexpectedly touching, finale. Add to that worthwhile ending a legendary Ron Grainer (Dr. Who, The Prisoner) soundtrack and some very quotable dialogue (""Thanks alot, you cheating bastard"") and THE OMEGA MAN rounds itself out into a very memorable movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Warner Bros. has continually delayed the release of OMEGA MAN on DVD - 4 years now counting.

Mercedes Ruehl is excellent as Susan Walker, a single mother who is sentenced to 20 years in federal prison simply because her live-in boyfriend and his cronies were peddling marijuana on a large scale.<br /><br />Walker refused to plea bargain since she considered herself to be innocent and devoid of inside information. Unfortunately, all of the other defendants in the case (they KNEW they were guilty) accepted a plea bargain, pointing their fingers at Walker as a co-conspirator to shorten their own sentences.

"I adored the Japanese version of ""Iron Chef"" and have watched every episode they aired in America. So, when I heard that production wrapped up, I was saddened...no more Chairman Kaga and no more Iron Chefs! However, soon after, there was an announcement that the show would be coming to America with a new cast and new Kitchen Stadium. I was excited. Then, sadly, it turned out that they tossed aside all the good elements of the original show and substituted it was an almost ""Jerry Springer"" and ""Gong Show"" atmosphere. Gone was the pageantry, subtlety and charm.<br /><br />The single worst thing about the new show was that the chefs were no longer men you could admire and love. Kinichi, Sakai, Nokamura and the rest seemed like really nice people--skilled, yet honorable and humble. Now, in this bastardized version from America, the chefs were combination mega-celebrities AND GQ cover models. The worst of these was Todd English (who starred in this premier show). He seemed more like the wrestler Gorgeous George coming into the arena than a real honest-to-goodness chef. In the process, he came off as very obnoxious, self-assured and arrogant...and quite pretty. Because of his boorish antics (such as tossing food into the audience and prancing), I swore I'd never eat at one of his restaurants and I never will. I saw him recently on QVC or HSN and think that this is more fitting for his ""talents"". No one cooks THAT good that it's worth putting up with all this phony image that the show's producers no doubt convinced English to adopt.<br /><br />The fact that English was so obnoxious was fortunate for the new chairman, William Shatner (who thought of Shatner!?!). While his performance was stupid, English so overshadowed Shatner that his wooden and dopey performance could be overlooked...a bit. Another problem is that when Americans watch the Japanese shows, they have no idea who Chairman Kaga is--and so it makes the idea of a real kitchen stadium seem almost possible. Most Americans don't know that Takeshi Kaga actually was a rather famous Japanese actor--famous for stage performances in plays by Andrew Lloyd Weber, TV and movies (such as the DEATH NOTE live action film). Not knowing all this actually was a plus in the States. You wanted to believe he really was the chairman of some mythic cooking arena!! <br /><br />Apart from English and Shatner, the rest of the show had much more of a tacky Vega-style look to it. Too many crazy camera tricks, special effects and absolutely no charm. For fans of the original, there just wasn't anything to like. Fortunately, the Food Network version that appeared a few years later was much closer to the original. While still not nearly as good as the original, as least it did not look like a deliberate parody of the show!!<br /><br />By the way, if you think I am being too rough on the show, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle said of the show ""'Iron Chef USA' an abomination"". That about says it all!",Performance,Others,
"Oh dear...<br /><br />It's easy to tell where this latest version of Conan Doyle's perennial classic goes wrong because so little goes right. There's little fault with the script, which does a decent job of retelling a by now overly familiar tale and even throws in an intriguingly Gothic Christmas Eve party for good measure. Some of the supporting performances are fine - John Nettles and Richard E. Grant in particular. But the leads are so very wrong that they sap the life from the thing.<br /><br />Ian Hart's Watson is surly and obnoxious, all too easily offended and trapped in a deeply distrustful relationship with Holmes. Since Watson has to carry much of the drama, this keeps us at arm's length from involvement, especially since Matt Day is such a dull Baskerville. However, where Hart is a good actor giving a misjudged performance, Richard Roxburgh gives every indication of being a bad actor giving a bad performance. He may not quite be the worst Holmes in the way that he was definitely the worst Dracula (in Van Helsing), but he's certainly the dullest and blandest despite his overstated distance and eccentricities, while the attempt to make him more of an action hero simply ends up making him a very ordinary figure instead. With all displays of Holmes' deductive reasoning dropped (even the famous scene with Dr Mortimer's walking stick is gone), his disguises omitted (he just appears on the moor as if he were still dressed for Baker Street) and his drug use wildly overdone (rather than resorting to narcotics when bored, he even jacks up in a public toilet while working on the case in this version), he's such a blunt bull in a China shop here that rather than pay the cabby for information, he beats him up instead as if he were a 19th century Popeye Doyle. <br /><br />Although David Attwood's direction throws up the odd good bit of composition, the grotty lighting and perpetual green tint on the original TV broadcast version sap any signs of life before they can bloom. And the less said about the shoddily animated CGi hound the better - despite the impressively populated London street scenes, it's hard to believe that this is probably the biggest budgeted version since Rathbone and Bruce strode the Moor. <br /><br />The BBC have previously had good luck with the tale - both their Peter Cushing and Tom Baker versions, studio-bound though they were, were more involving in their cosy Sunday teatime way. Sadly, this attempt to bring a more modern aesthetic, while marginally better than the dreadful Peter Cook and Dudley Moore spoof, is nonetheless a very poor show indeed.",Performance,Visual Effect,

"This feature, as you probably gathered, largely centres around Snoopy, Charlie Brown's dog.<br /><br />Charlie Brown has been becoming ever more resentful of Snoopy's recent independence (in particular going to the beach to spend time with Peppermint Patty), and, after cutting his thumb while trying to open his can of dog-food, he gives Snoopy a scolding and makes him feel guilty and worthless.<br /><br />The following day, when Snoopy tries to go to the beach to see Peppermint Patty again as promised, suddenly a sign has been put up saying that dogs are not allowed on the beach. This starts a chain reaction that begins a string of frustration within Snoopy...<br /><br />More snubbing comes from other members of the Peanuts gang when what started off as being a bit of fun with Linus and his security blanket soon turns sadistic and nasty, once again with Snoopy on the losing end.<br /><br />Snoopy then has a bit of fun with Linus' elder sister Lucy, who is using boxing gloves, and they have a bit of a light-hearted spar, but again Snoopy pushes things that little bit too far and ends up upsetting Lucy and she spits the dummy at him.<br /><br />Shortly afterwards, Snoopy receives a letter from a mysterious girl named Lila, who is in hospital and for some reason craves his presence. Snoopy and his bird friend Woodstock (making his animated film debut here) suddenly set off to meet her. Their journey is plagued by quite a few of the famous 'No dogs allowed'-type signs, which again do little to heighten the spirits of our favourite beagle!<br /><br />Eventually, however, Snoopy and Woodstock reach the hospital where Lila is staying, and her spirit does indeed rise when the dog suddenly appears by her bedside and enriches her enthusiasm. However, little does Snoopy know that she will practically coax her into doing something that will really tug at his heart-strings...<br /><br />I first saw this film as a boy in my early tens, and even when I watch it now it has lost none of its ability to endear and -- in particular -- choke. There is one particular section that still makes me cry to this day at a party for Snoopy, where poor Charlie Brown is just too choked to say anything. Even just THINKING about that scene induces tears...<br /><br />As a whole, though, the film is enjoyable fare. It's not a classic, but it's still memorable, and has some actually quite good songs that are not in the least bit intrusive and only add to the overall charm. There is also some spot humour, much of which is caused by Woodstock's erratic flying and Snoopy's constantly being taunted by the 'No dogs allowed' signs permating his venture.<br /><br />Recommended, but don't expect your eyes to be anything other than moist at some point in the film!",Plot,Performance,

From the few extras, it seems that the creators actually wanted to do well and take this seriously but it certainly doesn't show in the final product except for a lack of b-movie fun that might have actually made this palatable. The fight choreography was lame, the dialogs were cliché, the special effects were pathetic (except perhaps for the first dragon but even there...), the actors were either mediocre or stunningly uncharismatic and the story... well I don't remember what the story was nor did I care much about what was happening. Actually, I saw this not so long ago and I remember very little of it. I'm giving an extra half star for the effort and genuinely noble intentions of the filmmakers who did try to make it closer to the rpg and because I've seen worse.

"The first time I watched this film, I must have been about nine or ten and even at that age, I sobbed my heart out. To this day, it remains the saddest film I've ever seen.<br /><br />The film revolves around eight-year-old Ben Madison, a haemophiliac who contracted AIDS from an infected blood transfusion. As Ben bravely copes with all that his devastating illness forces upon him, his parents are fighting two battles. They have to struggle to accept the fact their young son was terminally ill yet remain strong enough to prepare him for his own death but they are also fighting the ignorance of how AIDS was perceived in the Eighties.<br /><br />'Go Toward the Light' has many emotive scenes: notably, Ben's funeral where his mother recounts how her son's life may have been short but he had made his mark on the world, when Ben's father explains to his three young sons about what happens to the soul after death, and the final scene where Ben dies in his parents' arms. What makes this film unique is that it's not all depressing and, by depicting happier scenes, we feel closer to Ben and his family. We shared their joy when Ben is able to come home for his new brother's birth and when the Madisons' newborn son was haemophiliac-free. We get a sense of how close the family is by the large role the grandparents play in Ben's life (his grandfather poignantly made Ben's coffin) and the love Ben feels for his family, especially his brothers (one bittersweet moment is when his younger brother says he was visited by a ghostly Ben in the hours before Ben's death).<br /><br />For a TV film, not only was the script excellent but so were the actors. Young Joshua Harris must have been a talented child actor in his time given his affecting performance as Ben while Linda Hamilton and Richard Thomas were perfect as the parents, depicting their grief, strength and love for their son and his plight.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to not only people seeking a good gut-wrenching drama (as there is nothing more gut-wrenching than watching this film and knowing this was a true story that happened to a real little boy and his family) but also for older children and teenagers seeking a more meaningful view of AIDS and its consequences.",Plot,Others,

Some of the extras were fun to watch, especially the old Drive-in Intermission clips. They sure brought back fond memories, of trips to the Drive-in during my childhood days.<br /><br />Just For The Hell Of It, was little more than a melodramatic yarn about violent, delinquent teens. This film stood-out from others of it's kind, by portraying the teen violence as particularly vicious. There was even a scene where a toddler was snatched from it's carriage, and put in a garbage can, by one of the teens. The incredible mayhem that these teens indulge in, is way beyond youthful hijinks. <br /><br />It's obvious that the producers of this movie, were trying to shock the sensibilities of the older generation in the 60s. Seems like back then, the under-30 crowd were forever keeping their elders bewildered. But very few young people, were actually as brutal back then, as they're portrayed to be in this movie. So the premise of the film, really stretches the bounds of credibility. This movie doesn't even work as a campy film. It's just too grisly, and lacks any real element of humor at all.

Not to mention the fact that I was quite a horror fan, in particular a zombie fan who was very familiar with the original Romero film. Needless to say this movie had a lot to prove in order to win me over. Well, it did. What Tom Savini and company were able to do out in the Pennsylvania countryside was nothing short of masterful. Of course I'm talking about horror here. This is no Cassablanca, but within its genre Night of the Living Dead is a standout. This film basically faithfully retells the original Remero story with the benefit of better make-up, special effects, cameras, lighting and cinematography.

Like I said, most are, but I think Hollywood needs a reality check.<br /><br />This leads me to Hide and Seek, a movie that is mediocre even with powerful actors like DeNiro, Fanning and Shue. For some reason, Bobby makes more mediocre films nowadays then he does quality. I realize you have to pay the bills, but come on. DeNiro is one of the best actors ever, and his movie choices lately (Godsend, which is horrible)have sucked. DeNiro should have looked at the script and then decided to burn it after reading the first 3 pages. Either that or he should have demanded a love scene with Elisabeth Shue for extra compensation. Fanning parents saw the $$$$ there little girl would earn, and signed her up real quick. Well, that is my theory, cause she is way better than this garbage.<br /><br />Fanning plays the ""creepy little kid"", and DeNiro plays her psychiatrist dad. Mom kills herself in the beginning of the movie, or at least that is what it looks like. Darling daughter becomes depressed and creepy, and daddy decides to move from the city to the country for a new start. Turns out the move is a bad idea, cause (excluding Shue's character) all the residents of this small town that we meet are creepy too. And why is it that small town folk are always creepy? Big cities have there fair share of freaks as well, but for some reason, this movie (along with many others) wants you to believe that small town folks are crazy as hell. Anyways, this movie goes from okay to flat out ridiculous in no time at all, and once the big ""surprise"" comes at the climax of the film, you feel as if you have seen this movie somewhere before. That is due to the fact that Hide and Seek turns into a rehash of many other films. Sad thing is the fact that Hide and Seek wants to be different........but it isn't.<br /><br />I'll give Fanning credit. She does play her role well, and it was because of her that I watched this whole thing. This is a dark role for her, and she seems to eat it up. She does have a bright future ahead of her, but she needs to avoid crap like this.",Performance,Visual Effect,Directional Techniques
"Peter Weir's first film and, looking back to when I originally saw this on general release, this could be described as my first exploitation movie. I always had a soft spot for it and later recognised elements from such video treats as, 2000 Maniacs. Not overlong, it still seems a little slow now at times but it's probably because unlike in the mid 70s when this was considered unique , so much else has been seen. Even so it's well worth watching and whilst in my memory this was all about dressed up cars battling it out, this is , in fact, much more a cynical view of the director's homeland. The mayor who at first seems protective and halfway decent turns out to be the 'fascist' for whom this whole enterprise is run. Paris, Australia, of course, not France although the enigmatic finale will have you guessing.",Plot,Performance,
"I was flipping through the channels and saw this was on this afternoon. It is a very poorly done remake. Many of the lines were so poorly delivered that I got the impression that the actors new it wasn't going to be very good. <br /><br />On the other hand, I highly recommend the original Jimmy Stewart version. It has all of the charm that this version lacks. Stewart's Dowd cannot help but be loved, while Anderson's Dowd feels wooden, and I ordinarily like Harry Anderson. When watching the original, you find yourself hoping that Harvey is real and you come to love him. In the remake, you find yourself not believing that any of the characters are real. They all come across as actors on a stage acting a part rather than actually being the characters. If you want to see Harvey, do yourself a favor and see the original. This version is not very good.",Plot,Others,
"As someone who has watched 1000's of films and actually likes foreign films, this was one of the most whacked-out movies I have ever watched. I fully appreciate that the subject matter is unconventional, and that people who get into such weird mental places do not have pedestrial social behavior. Also, most French films tend to take on unusualy subject manner and are much more direct in approach than US films when it comes to sex and sexuality. However, I feel like I was being thrown against a wall with one morally disgusting scene after another. I suppose it doesn't help when you instantly hate the main character, wonder if any of the adults act like adults (much less who isn't sexually overcharged), wonder why none of the teens have any common sense, and it just keeps going. You gain sympathy for certain characters and you realize the reason none of the adults act like adults is because...well..they have real problems. I will say it is beautifully shot and the direction just adds to the intensity, but thats about I can come up with in terms of redeeming qualities in what is one big mess!",Visual Effect,Others,

"PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM has one of the most quotable (and joke-able) line in cinema history: ""I'm so depressed."" It introduces Woody Allen as a complete neurotic who can't seem to look at the open doors all around him and prefers to consult an analyst -- be it an actual psychiatrist or us, the viewer -- and whine about his inability to relate to the little things in life without creating some turbulent drama complete with hoots and clicks. It's survived to this day, and whenever his name comes up, people tend to sigh and think, ""Oh no -- more angst coming from successful white people from the Upper East Side!"" <br /><br />However, this is not a Woody Allen movie. This is Herbert Ross' adaptation of a Woody Allen play, but it's done in such a way that from start to finish it resembles the type of comic fantasies Allen himself would direct in the latter part of the Seventies and from then on. PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM tells the story of Allan Felix, a film critic whose wife Nancy (Susan Anspach) has left him because she, plain and simple, needs excitement. (Sounds familiar? He would explore a near-identical situation with the relationship between Alvy Singer and Annie Hall.) Allan of course, becomes depressed. Because his apartment is a shrine to all things Humphrey Bogart (the movie begins with Allan at an art-house movie theatre at the end of CASABLANCA), it's no surprise when Bogart makes his own appearance and gives Allan pointers about how to react to women while telling him what went wrong. At the same time, Linda and Dick (Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts), his married friends, also make their appearance and try to see if prospective matches can take Allan off of his arrested development. Sadly -- or should I say, hilariously -- every women they set Allan up with proves to be dismal failures, but the surprising thing is that the more time Allan and Linda spend time together, the more they find that they relate to each other. It's just time when pressure from Bogart and Allan's own growing gumption will make him take the next step.<br /><br />One of the most remarkable things in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM is how it becomes the first Woody Allen story to incorporate fantasy as a part of reality in a way that doesn't seem gimmicky. No dreamy music, no special effects -- they just appear, in Allan's mind, cohabiting and egging him on in his neuroses. Bogart suddenly materializing in the background, in shadows, is priceless (and Jerry Lacy virtually channels Bogart's mannerisms and voice down to a science), but so is a sequence when Allan and Linda are sitting on the sofa. Allan is receiving pressure from Bogart to make a move on her. Suddenly, an angry Nancy makes her announcement, complete with a gun, and shoots Bogart in classic film-noir fashion. Needless to say, Allan and Linda resolve their issue separately, but it's a clever move, one that would make its appearance in a plethora of situations in subsequent movies. However, blending the events of CASABLANCA as a part of what transpires between Allan and Linda elevates the more comedic aspects of PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM to a very touching moment. It's part of Allen's way of paying homage to the classic films that were made when he was growing up, and he would return to this again in THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO with equally clever results.",Plot,Performance,

"I love the horror genre! I grew up loving films that scared the hell out of me! Candyman is excellent because it is a film that I genuinely found very twisted and disturbing when I saw it at the tender age of 15.<br /><br /> Check this out, 'It is a blessed condition believe me. To be whispered about in street corners...to live in other peoples dreams...but not to have to be...do you understand?' <br /><br /> How cool is that quote! I am going to throw in a few quotes in this review because the writing of this film is really, really cool! The Candyman is not an inarticulate Jason or Michael Myers. He has the vocabulary of a homicidal drama professor who likes Richard Burton. Candyman is the thinking person's horror film. It explores the notion of the urban myth. The Candyman exists because people tell the stories about him. They spread the myth making him flesh.<br /><br /> Unfortunately for researcher Helen Lyle, she doesn't know any of this. She investigates the urban myth of the Candyman, seeking to debunk it and her fate becomes sealed. Hey! Writing a paper isn't worth being burned alive! The film rests on the central idea that fiction can suddenly become real life if enough people believe in the myth. Boogey men can therefore be created if enough people believe in monsters. This theme is familiar to the director Bernard Rose. I recommend another one of his films called 'Paperhouse.' This is about the imagination of a little girl that starts to manifest in reality. It is also quite good although not as scary. The original story of how the Candyman was made is horrific and just deepens the mystery. This is not a film like the Friday the 13th series. This is far more cerebral and relies much more on its concepts. <br /><br /> The Candyman is the whisper in the classroom that will exist forever. When Helen sets out to debunk the Candyman, this is essentially like trying to murder him. 'Your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation. Without them, I am nothing.' Debunking the Candyman will destroy his immortality. The only way the Candyman can exist is through the shedding of innocent blood so that the stories of him can continue to proliferate. So when Helen decides that the Candyman is actually a local drug dealer hiding behind the Candyman identity. She feels that she has solved the mystery of the mysterious murders that the Candyman has committed. What Helen does not know is that the Candyman is a kind of a physical manifestation of the Jungian collective unconscious. The Candyman takes his revenge, he feels obliged to come, after all she has caused much doubt about his actual existence. The Candyman tears away Helen's day to day reality. Driving her into what other people think is her own insanity. Now she knows the truth of the Candyman...<br /><br /> The conversations between Helen and the Candyman are haunting. What is also interesting is that sadism and masochism are major features in Clive Barker's work. 'The pain I assure you, will be exquisite.' S&M tendencies! This is one dark and twisted piece of celluloid! The acting is also really good from both actors. The final scene is horrific as Helen tries to rescue a baby in a blazing woodpile and is burnt alive! Helen herself then becomes part of the legend and therefore comes back as another physical manifestation of legend. However, remember this is not Helen's ghost but a construction of Helen through the beliefs of those who believe this mysterious urban legend. Candyman says it best...<br /><br /> 'Your death will be a tale to frighten children...to make lovers cling closer in their rapture. Come with me and be immortal...' Genius.<br /><br /> This film also has a great soundtrack, a very haunting score.<br /><br /> Candyman is a very interesting film that originates from the absolutely twisted mind of Clive Barker. This is brilliant, well written horror. 9 out of 10. <br /><br /> By the way avoid the sequels. I saw number 2 and it just ruins the whole thing. Think of this as the one and only.",Visual Effect,,
"Someone made the unwise decision early on to stick as close to the hit Broadway play as possible in adapting ""The Bad Seed"" for the movies, including having several key actors reprise their roles, including Patty McCormick in the lead as a sociopathic youngster in long pig-tails. The piece has not been rethought for the screen, and what works on a bare stage doesn't always deliver in the more intimate medium of cinema. So it's not all McCormick's fault: she delivers a performance of a headstrong, evil child in a perfunctory, overly-rehearsed manner and probably deserved the accolades she received at the time. It is a very demanding role for a youngster. However, there are no shadings in the dialouge for McCormick to pick up on, and she's not fresh in the part. Worse, she's directed to be too terrific--enunciating very clearly and loudly, as if to reach the back row, all the details of a complex human being are ironed out. This couldn't possibly have been intentional, as the rest of the cast members are handled in the very same way. It's so forthright, uneasy, repetitive and awkward, it becomes a static transformation of stage material onto film. *1/2 from ****",Plot,Visual Effect,Others
"I wanted to give this movie a 2 out of 10 rating for some interesting special effects, but I just can't.

Reno is the one holding it together, although his ennui is rather more phoned-in for this one. And simply putting Christopher Lee in a film - doing his sect-leader yet again - does not rubber-stamp it with integrity (he's left out to dry almost as much as the redundant chick-interest, Natta).<br /><br />I did, however, enjoy an unwittingly (?) postmodern thrill-sequence set in the supermarket.

"Have you ever heard the expression ""so stupid it is brilliant""? Well, you will see plenty of stupidity on offer here. So much of it, in fact, that you will begin to understand where the expression ""so bad that it is awesome"" comes from. Forget about Mortal Kombat, or even Resident Evil: Apocalypse. This is the film that video game adaptations get their reputation from. Every error of film-making you can think of, and even some you can't, is committed here. So many acting careers die here that the film should have been called Career Holocaust. You can bet that many members of the support cast neglect to mention this effort when discussing their CVs. About the only cast member who seems to have recovered from being in this abomination is Tchéky Karyo, and I am sure even he would rather forget this one. Incidentally, since when do you cast an actor with a French accent as thick as pea soup to play a character who was known in the early video games for having a Scottish accent so broad that it cemented the games reputation as a collection of stereotypes. Incidentally, Angel was supposed to be the French accent.<br /><br />But this is all pure digression. The cast's collective heart was in it, and the crew did the best job they could, but the direction is so weak that the film winds up looking like it was intended to form the cutscenes of a video game. No explanation for the technology on show is offered. No reference to the time in which the film takes place is offered. Many references place the film in the time just after the declaration of war against the Kilrathi. But the scenario being depicted shows the Kilrathi imminently approaching Earth, which was one of the available scenarios in the third video game, which in turn is set decades into the war. Not to mention the stealth technology, which is introduced some years into the war, and yet the most prominent fighters of the Terran confederation look like rejected designs for World War II aircraft with shower nozzles stuck to their fronts.<br /><br />The spacecraft design leads me to believe that members of the crew might be at least half right when they say that the problem with this film is the budget. In a time when science-fiction theatre was costing upwards of a hundred million per film, a miniscule thirty million was spent on this production. It shows. Shots of the main enemy in anything other than spacecraft form are rare, and when we do finally get to see the Kilrathi, they look more like big turds than humanoid cats. In one memorable sequence, we get to see a wrecked space fighter, with its pilot still within, pushed off the runway by a futuristic bulldozer that seems to grip the tarmac using the traditional wheel arrangement. In zero gravity, mind you. Of course, the runway could have gravity wells, or the bulldozer could have magnetically-charged wheels, but this is something the director or the screenwriter is supposed to explain to the audience. Very little explanation of anything, even why the Pilgrims are so space-savvy, is offered. There is basically a whole lot of tell and very little show.<br /><br />Speaking of the Pilgrims, a subplot is added to this film that states the original Human explorers of space were a group dubbed the Pilgrims, who began to renounce their Human qualities. Apparently, a war started between the Pilgrims and the rest of Humanity, with the present Terran Confederation beset by a severe prejudice against Pilgrims. This is all well and fine, but it adds nothing to the actual plot, and only muddies the waters as to what the Humans are fighting about. All it really serves to do is give our central hero a Luke Skywalker sort of quality, and not a very convincing one at that. The idiotic game the Terran pilots play that dead pilots basically never existed flies right in the face of every convention set in the original video games. And it isn't like the crew have the excuse of not having played the games, because the director is the same guy who oversaw their creation. All this turns out to be is a very stupid attempt at a creative plot arc that, like the Pilgrim element, has no bearing upon the story whatsoever.<br /><br />Unlike most of the rotten films I have commented about lately, I gave Wing Commander a one out of ten. Watching the cast, respectable otherwise or no, trying to chew their way through boot-like dialogue is pure comedy gold. Realising that the director expects us to feel scared of these gigantic turd monsters he calls the Kilrathi is even funnier. Therefore, Wing Commander is not just so bad it is good. It is so stupid it is utterly brilliant.",Performance,Directional Techniques,Plot

"People people people. Whew. Let's not be hasty, selfish or unreasonable. Sure this movie had it's flaws. The Locale's may have seemed just a teensy bit artificial(the most common critique), but downing the movie because Sam Jackson ""stole"" the violin, and on top of that attributing it to his color is downright UNCALLED FOR!<br /><br />And further more, to say that ""the times we live in"" are the reason for us over looking the fact the violin was whisked away immorally is a clear fall back on cliche for a lack of intelligence. Because that's what this person is challenging. The morality of what Jackson did in the closing moments of the movie. If we were to really analyze the morality from each owner to the next, we would find that morality was not really the wave of fortune the violin was riding on(it was stolen from a grave for crying out loud, not to mention almost burned for simply being... a violin). If not liking it because of it's closing immorality is not missing the point and the essence and the true exsistence of this film, then I don't know what is.<br /><br />This movie, as shockingly revealed as it was, was not about the life of this inanimate object. Surely the violin did not have a life. It was merely the carrier for the essence of the character of Anna Bussotti, Nicolo's wife. Because he used her to complete the instrument, it was endowed with her essence. That is where you are to find your morality in the tale. That life, our life, our essence, our being, is lived not only in our bodies, in these pathetic heaps of flesh and bone, but in everything around us. The morality is that Nicolo's love for his wife, made her immortal in the violin, and her song, was a gift passed down to each of the ones touched by the violin's life.<br /><br />Therefore it is quite inconsequential, the morality of the people(and their actions) and events surrounding the violin, to say that it is the times we live in, or the race of the man stealing the violin, because the story encompasses a much higher enlightenment. Easily seen, too, if you don't analyze the mistemperments and shortcomings of the people surrounding the voilin to a point where they consume your vision, blocking the ""true"" lesson or moral, or whatever you want to call it.

It's not that he turned down the opportunity to apply to be an astronaut, it's that Chuck Yeager wasn't allowed to apply. When seraching for astronauts Harry Shearer's character praises Yeager as the ace of aces, but goes on to say that he ""doesn't fit the profile"" of the type of man Washington is looking for because he never went to college. This was a true pre-requisite which the Mercury Program had. Also, the scene at the end where Yeager crashes his NF-104 doesn't bring him down, it glorifies him.

Yeager may have crashed his plane in his last flight of the movie, but he emerges as a fearless man ever up for the challenge. And that he's not doing any of it for fame or fortune (although in real life the real Yeager cashed in with TV ads and a best-selling autobiography after both the book and the movie were released!!). That's what's rare about this movie for Hollywood to have made. Films are almost never about measuring a man's inner desires, but rather his being able to win the fight at the end. Yeager in contrast doesn't win the flight record at the film's end, but he is still the hero. This is because he dares to do what we never would. And even after his plane crashes he walks out of the gulf of fire and smoke with a severely burned face as if he will be back; you can't keep him down. This is why as the rescuer driving the ambulance as he sees Yeager's figure walking out of the fire in the distance asks, ""Is that a man?"", Jack Ridley replies, ""You're damn right it is!"". Ridley isn't merely remarking that it's a man over there, he is commenting that in our world Yeager is one of the few true ""men"". This film is not about the space program. That is merely a pretext to explore the type of men who have what it takes to volunteer for dangerous missions - even in times of peace. It's about men who have The Right Stuff - and of all those men whom we see in the movie it is Yeager who shines about all others.",Plot,Performance,

It had a great love story in the middle of a mildly sensible crime story.<br /><br />The story of a rich prude, bored with her life, who finally finds something interesting to fulfill her time: skating. But when a man comes to replace their beloved skating rink with a mini mall, she will stop at nothing to stop him. Her skating friends and boyfriend are the only ones who will stick with her.

"Audie Murphy is one of the nation's most beloved souls, not only as an actor, but his exploits on the battlefront during WWII, becoming the most decorated soldier in history, and rising far in the military at the tender age of 19 made him an inspiration for us all. To Hell and Back is his story.<br /><br />A true story based on Murphy's autobiography, THaB is beyond its time in that the visuals are absolutely stunning for a movie made in 1955. When watching it for the first time, I thought it was made in the late 1960's or early 1970's. Audie Murphy provides a realistic and moving performance as himself. The film is not only about Murphy's exploits in the war, but the people he met and became great friends with. It also shows the sorrow and tragedy of war very well, throwing in some romantic moments here and there, which is nice relief from all the action. What you'll realize about Murphy's performance is how real it is, because it's a rare moment in movies when someone plays themselves in an actual moment that changed their lives.<br /><br />Go watch this great war movie. It's a classic that all war films should definitely take reference from. You'll have a good time with it, guaranteed.<br /><br />8/10 --spy",Plot,,
"One thing I know about this film is that Burial Ground director Andrea Bianchi must have had a great time making it, as filming naked women and bloody murders looks like a lot of fun! As the lurid title suggests, Strip Nude for Your Killer is one of the more trashy examples of the Giallo tradition, and that has lead many to lambaste it as a sub-par effort; I, however, could not disagree more! The film is definitely over the top and silly, but that's the reason I watch Giallo, so criticising it for that is ridiculous. The film takes in pretty much every trash element of the style of film-making, from naked babes to a masked killer and the film is like a catalogue of less than tasteful actions and images. Strip Nude for Your Killer opens with a shot that leaves nothing to the imagination, and shows a woman having an abortion in a backstreet 'medical centre'. After she dies, her gynaecologist arranges for the corpse to be put in a bath full of water. He is killed soon after, and it doesn't take long for more dead bodies to begin piling up at the modelling agency where the unfortunate young girl worked...<br /><br />It is customary for the Giallo murderer to don black gloves for his crimes, but Bianchi goes all the way again with this idea and has his killer completely dressed in motorcycle leathers! The film benefits from a thick layer of sleaze that runs throughout and fans of lurid cinema are likely to be in heaven with Strip Nude for Your Killer. The fast paced plot is bolstered by some very graphic and nasty murders, as well as a plentiful helping of sex scenes; some of which involve Italy's finest Giallo actress, Edwige Fenech! Fenech has had her hair cut down for her role here, but she's still the sexy little minx that Giallo fans love her for being, and seeing her strip nude is always a treat! It's obvious that the plot itself wasn't important to the director as the film doesn't feature a lot of plot points and the unmasking of the murderer completely lacks any mystery. This film won't do anything for people that like their movies to be politically correct, as the women use their bodies more than their brains and the twisted sense of humour is liable to offend. None of that deterred me, however, as while I admit that this isn't the greatest Giallo...I really, really enjoyed watching it. Recommended!",Plot,Others,
"Pride and prejudice, betrayal and revenge, lust and purity, kidnappings, tournaments, and ransoms... what better ingredients could be assembled in one film? This retelling of Ivanhoe has many exceptional qualities, including first-rate cinematography and chivalric music. But the quality of this Ivanhoe lies in the casting. James Mason plays an excellent Isaac of York, and Olivia Hussey's Rebecca is every bit as passionate as Elizabeth Taylor's. Lysette Anthony has all the ingenue quality of a Saxon princess; yet one wonders whom Ivanhoe would have chosen to marry if race and religious prejudices had not been the order of the day. One of the strengths of this film was, to my mind, the triumvirate of villains Bois-Guilbert, de Bracy, and Front de Boeuf. Sam Neill is brilliant as the knight torn between his order and his obsession with a ""Jewess heathen"", and Stuart Wilson shines in the supporting role of the besotted de Bracy. This film was released on video at one point, as I rented it from a video store. I highly recommend it.",Others,Directional Techniques,
"While the story of St. John's Wort is something I could easily imagine coming out of Hammer Films, or a classic Vincent Price movie, it's not BAD, and the visuals more than make up for it.<br /><br />PLOT: Nami inherits a spooky old mansion, takes her ex-boyfriend along so they can scope out using the place as a setting for their video game. Turns out she may have had a twin who died when she was a child. Also turns out her father was a crazy artist, who painted creepy pictures. Is the house haunted? Is the twin still alive? Who is the spooky caretaker? See what I mean by it being very Vincent Price-ish? Anyway, the plot is fairly solid, though I did find at least one of the ending plot twists useless and incomprehensible, but since it really affected nothing else in the film, I ignored it.<br /><br />The VISUALS, on the other hand...<br /><br />The whole movie is oddly colored, which is unsettling to begin with, and which makes sections of it look like they might be CGI, or bluescreened, or might just be badly tinted - all adding to the unreality of the whole thing. Also, the camera ""view"" keeps shifting, from ""reality"" to the ex's hand-held camera, to B&W surveillance cameras, and even to a ""video game version"".<br /><br />My favorite bit of unreality involves the caretaker - when they arrive at the place, the caretaker gives Nami the keys, but the scene is played out as a video game sequence, with the caretaker icon's lines being printed on the screen, rather than spoken - thus making it impossible to determine anything, even gender, about this ""person"".<br /><br />Overall, I found it very watchable.",Directional Techniques,Plot,

"Middling adaptation of Roger Hedden's play about four twentysomethings in small Arizona town trying to find some truth in their lives. Acting showcase for Eric Stoltz, Bridget Fonda, Phoebe Cates and Tim Roth is surprisingly uneventful--and mercilessly slow-moving. Performances by Fonda and Cates outclass the men, with Roth a real irritant as a feckless drifter (of course, the character as written isn't exactly a charmer). Some of the dialogue is sharp and there are interesting bits and pieces. Stoltz also co-produced, and the small budgeted film has a very stylish, quasi-surreal look that bolsters the limp action. ** from ****",Others,,
"coming from a huge horror fan, i normally have an open mind watching new horror films but i had to rate this film a 1, when it really deserves a -86. this not only was one of the complete worst movies i have ever seen, it is a complete disgrace to horror movies in general. i do not know how this crap even got made. i am not sure what year it was to take place in, but at no time did police cars look like 86' buicks spray painted black. second of all, i thought this was a slasher, since when do slashers not have any blood/gore? that is the point of a slaher film last time i checked. i am still not sure about the ""killer"" in this movie, OK i get he was an escaped mental patient that looked like an idiot, but was he also a super hero? he sure seemed to throw like one. i could go on forever about this movie, from its awful direction and cinematography to its lighting and its score, not to mention the films amazing acting. why don't these people have an Oscar yet? these people definitely did not even pass drama class in high school.<br /><br />overall, this is the worst movie i have ever seen and a complete disgrace to horror films, if your going to make a horror film, do it right. i do not recommend this to any person on the planet to watch this piece of filth.

I explored that the realism within was quite lacklustre, with reference to when Van Damme's character escapes from the crucifiction cross - then began a mighty fighting scene, which was highly disappointing to the viewer.<br /><br />The antagonist was also quite disappointing on appearance and acting skills. His fighting technique was quite pitiful, and although so was Van Damme's, the slugfest was rightly won by the 'Muscles from Brussels'.<br /><br />To recommend this film to a friend, would make them believe that i was the enemy.

"I'd only seen this movie once before, when I was about 12 or 13. It wasn't as good as I remembered it as being but still better than 80-90% of the kids' movies these day. I've seen quite a few Holmes films and, in my opinion, the performances of and chemistry between whoever is playing Holmes and Watson is what largely determines the success or failure of the movie. I'm glad to say that Nicholas Rowe and Alan Cox (son of Brian) were both excellent in their roles and the development of their relationship is nicely handled. It's such a shame that this didn't lead to bigger and better roles for either of them.<br /><br />Rowe and Cox (and the script, of course) made younger versions of two of the most iconic characters in all of literature credible as teenagers while still more or less staying true to the spirit of the characters in Holmes canon. So often where you get younger versions of established characters, it doesn't work but this is a definite exception. The story is not as strong or as tight as it could have been and occasionally veers a bit too much into Indiana Jones territory (unsurprisingly) for my tastes but, hey, it works in the context of the film which is the main thing.

For a start the digital video camera is not a steadicam, and even if she was joking ITS NOT FUNNY!! the script consists of stolen Cannibal Holocaust lines and images with the main part being a swamp of incoherent crap that only the most messed up mind could comprehend and think is slightly decent. this film also contains some of the lamest picture in picture effects I've ever seen. with its token 80's porn soundtrack and English dubbed over English this film has made me realize that some movies need to be sunk below a 1 grade on the voting scale. and for some strange reason everyone keeps talking to the camera even the people that aren't in the jungle i.e DIGBY. this film makes no sense what-so-ever as the start of the movie portrays the jumping of time between past and present-i mean seriously WTF?!?! to make it even more awful is the 2minute appearance of the German priest that introduces us to the guide Garcia.

"This was a very good film if you dig any of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series (preferably Parts 3 or 4). You can see it has that Freddy Krueger vibe running through its veins. Right down to the colorful shadows, neato killings, and anti-hero villain. But it also stands on its own much more than some similiar Nightmare knockoffs (Leprechaun comes to mind, in fact this film plays like a much more effective Leprechaun 4: Lep in the Hood).<br /><br />Snoop Dogg does very well in the role of Bones, making lines like, ""The Gangster of Love don't need no fried chicken"" sound very serious and convincing.

"This completes the new series, and takes the consequence of the ones before it, similar to how Warrior Within(the saving method of which this retains) built on the first. It has elements of both of them, and adds quite a lot(and far more than aforementioned earlier sequel). You may still wield two weapons, but now the choice of the other one... sword, mace, dagger or axe... affects the way you do so, in the range, force, etc. of the blows. There are still many different ones within those four kinds. The Free Form Fighting System is also still in use, so spamming powerful attacks is still possible, however, this comes closer to The Sands of Time in the combat, with more strategy and tactics necessary, among other things because of those archers... arrows in general are present in this, and they are very welcome. The battles are longer and tougher, and do not get tedious like they did in the one immediately preceding this. Making things interesting is also the fact that you no longer use a lengthy blade as usual... and I will leave it at that, lest I spoil something. One can also tell that the good people at Ubisoft had Splinter Cell on their mind... a couple of the new moves are right out of those, and stealth is a genuine option at several places. They make it work, and it doesn't stand out as (much as) one might think. Speed Kills are part of this... and no, that's not a campaign telling us to slow down on the freeway, nor one against that particular drug. It's a way to take out opponents, typically when they aren't yet aware of your proximity, and all you truly need is to get the timing right, albeit the first time you try the specific ones, before you know what's coming, you will have to react split-second, as well as not get trigger-happy. It works impeccably well, and really adds to this. The Bosses vary, but at their best, they're incredible. The plot is great, picking up where the last one left off, confirming which of the endings they used, and taking you through one place that had yet to be visited in these three... The Prince's home, Babylon. Only it's not how he remembers it, and you'll soon find out why. The idea is magnificent, and making your way through the city is entertaining. As a character, he grows and develops a lot in this, and this really does close this version, these post-2000 entries, well. The voice acting is all satisfactory. Yuri is back, and thankfully, he left the vast majority of the emo back in the first one, but he did bring the humor with him, as well as what comes of his inner talks with his... other half(who's got a nasty case of cynicism). Yes. In this, you also get to control the Dark side of the leading man sometimes, who's stronger, but whose life gradually drains, one of the aspects of this making for serious tension. Does the word Daggertail mean anything to you? Once you've gotten to use it in this, it definitely will. It is a lot of fun, downright addictive, and a marvelous spice for the squaring off against enemies(and it can be used at points for maneuvering, marvelous). You once again get to use the special abilities. The chariot racing is pure awesomeness captured perfectly. The foes are relatively diverse, and less annoying than those of WW. The camera is a little limited, compared to the ones before this, and the panoramic view is less available, and once or twice, even kinda phoned in. The story-telling is similar to SoT. This gets you into it the fastest, and is also the shortest of them. There are graphic glitches and even bugs beyond the others, and it is sadly not as stable, either. This can be disturbing, though it is not as bleak as the second one. There are grotesque creatures herein. The tone is a mix of the others. The style is achieved well, and this uses slow-motion rather well. This also requires patience, reflexes, fingers adept at VG's, and time. The AI is nice, in that they all respond and act the way you'd expect them to. The re-playability is reasonable, you earn Sand Credits as you go, and if you get them all, you will unlock everything, in all of the artwork galleries. And you may just gain something else, as well. The videos(sadly, sans subtitles, although mostly, you can tell what's said) become available upon completion, all but one are the ones you watched along the way in this, and that one is an absolutely hilarious, if criminally brief, gag reel. The cut-scenes are well-done, and can be fairly effective. The CGI is utterly stunning. The animation and look of everything is fantastic. The level design is perhaps the tiniest step down from earlier in these, here and there, but overall it remains at the high quality of them. They utilize the new moves and acrobatics unbelievably well. The puzzles are still well-done, and this can be challenging, and should satisfy a decent range of people, with three difficulty settings. Do you like those ledges that fall off after you step on them? Well, they've made a triumphant return. The audio is well-done, everything sounds the way it should, and the music is nice. The heavy metal of the middle chapter is gone. The attitude towards nudity in this is the same as the earlier two, but it does somehow seem less provocative. The violence is debatable, but there is some blood. There is next to no gore. Language is nonexistent. I recommend this, and the entire franchise up to this point(the pre-beginning of new millennium-ones are immensely well-done, as well, they just happen to be old, and you can tell), to any fan of action-adventure titles, anyone who enjoys the culture, and all who appreciate swordsmanship in games. 8/10",Plot,Visual Effect,Others
"Not the worst film I have ever seen (""The Fourth Kind"" is the current champion in that particular category), but considering the charm of the series I must ask ""what in Sodor were these film makers thinking?"" The idea of a human being able to interact with the trains and people of Sodor has some appeal; sadly that - and watching Alec Baldwin having a ball and Peter Fonda attempting to ""keep it real, man"" - is the only high point in this film. I had to wonder what sort of medications were being abused by the scriptwriters, or perhaps they never mentally left the psychedelic sixties. Fans of the Thomas series will want to fast-forward through the live action sequences (which truly never match the Sodor world) to get to the train sequences. It is almost like watching two different movies at the same time, but spliced onto one reel.

"A pretty dreadful French thriller in which a gifted scenarist may be learning how to direct. The 126 minutes' length hints of a genre-piece that can't stop itself: the director wrote twice as many fainting scenes, dream sequences, and face-offs between heroine-villain as any film could sustain, and then left in every damned one of them. Its only suspense lies in the gradually revealed nastiness of the director himself-- ""He's not going to do THAT to his actors.... My God, he really IS."" The casting and the peculiar violations of genre logic show vestiges of a much better movie than BAMBI. In a day full of interesting French films shown at Boston's MFA, this ringer, of course, turned out to be the only one secured for American distribution.

The sound on the movie is really awful. I'm tired of seeing productions where you don't know in what year you're talking about. There's a misconception of time in all the movie.

Angela Landsbury as Mrs. Potts sings the title song with so much feeling that every time I hear the song, I'm swept away back to that ballroom.<br /><br />I was also moved by Belle's strength of self worth and generosity. She is a heroine I'd love girls to emulate. She knows what she wants, but yet is sensitive to others in trying to achieve that goal. She also learns to apologize and to forgive, no small task.<br /><br />I've loved this movie from the start, and it has grown into an obsession. I collect everything I can now, and watch it when I need a lift. So I know my opinion is strongly biased : ) but I hope you get a chance to see this film and judge for yourself.

"Somewhere at the core of Horsemen there is a good idea and a riveting premise. The execution, however, is all style and too little substance. There may have been a great screenplay at the beginning of the development of this project, but if there was, it got into the wrong hands along the way. The end product is a mess, like Frankenstein's monster, as if it were pieced together from material from past, better films. <br /><br />Every single ""serial killer on the loose"" movie cliché is lined up, making Horsemen a tribute to these flicks or a ""best of"" compilation at best and a sad copy at worst. There is a neat twist almost half way through that cannot be described without spoiling the central premise, the only truly interesting part in the film, but in the end nothing remotely remarkable is done with it. <br /><br />I am very sure that the people at Platinum Dunes are very good at what they do and they consciously aim their releases at a specific genre audience and most of their films are a success in that respect (I liked the raw energy of the Friday the 13th remake) but Horsemen is a failure of diabolical proportions. Dennis Quaid looks like he's sleepwalking through his role and his character is ridiculously clichéd. The rest of the cast cannot really do anything with their roles either, their characters being sketches at most  there is not one credible personality in this film's universe. <br /><br />Photography is great, though: the film looks slick  just like an episode of CSI. The similarities do not end there; there are even a couple of those CGI zooms into wounds accompanied by a metallic sound. In fact, the whole film reminds me of an episode of a Bruckheimer TV procedural, only somewhat more gruesome. <br /><br />Thankfully brief, Horsemen clocks in at a mere 80 minutes, but there isn't a single memorable moment in the entire experience.

"After looking at all of the comments, regarding it as an awful slasher, I must say in my opinion they are totally wrong.<br /><br />This had all the gore you need, maybe it could of had more, but still has a bloody edge, and the effects wern't all the terrible, even though towards the end when the woman is being grabbed by her hair when she's hanging off the Lighhouse does look a little bit stupid. This actually had above average acting, the characters arn't as wooden as some actors. But it is a B-Movie, and this has proudly made it's way into my top 5 in slashers.<br /><br />I'd give The Lighthouse - 7.5/10<br /><br />God bless British horror...now go watch Cradle Of Fear (Ultimate cheese, awful acting and terrible dialogue = a must for any horror fan like me)",Plot,Performance,
"I have seen many terrible movies, most of which can be fun to watch if only to make fun of them. This movie is worse than those. The dialogue is terribly delivered (the best delivery is from the comic-relief robot!), terribly written (contrived, preachy, and generally painful). As an example, the dialogue is littered with things like ""I am going to make more noise than two skeletons making love in a tin coffin."" And by littered I don't mean a sprinkle, I mean virtually wall to wall, most of it is even completely gratuitous. Also any movie that has a line like ""what is this some kind of bad sci-fi flick"". Just avoid this movie. It sucks you in. I sat watching wondering how it could get any worse... and it does. Each twist and turn takes this movie deeper into the abyss. 1/10 (which is as low as it goes!)",Plot,Visual Effect,Directional Techniques
"Just some general observations: 1)The men are mostly spineless, flawed, and one-dimensional. It reminds me of Dennis Miller's story about the Lifetime channel production of ""Guys and Dolls"", renamed ""Oppressors and Women of Vision and Strength"".<br /><br />2) This show was obviously written with its PC liberal feminist heart on its sleeve. The Indian woman who can't decide whether she wants to be a doctor stayed around way too long, and spouts her disgust with American culture at every turn. Corday is a slut, and Kovach (sp?) is a womanizer. Weaver is just not believable as a lesbian; her naming the trans-gender studies unit after Romano smacked of childish revenge.<br /><br />3)I miss George Clooney and Anthony Edwards and Julianne Margulies (what a babe). I always felt that their performances (esp. Edwards') were classy and understated.<br /><br />4) It gets worse and worse. Where is ""The Day After"" when you really need it? This show needs to be put out of its (and our)misery, and soon. I put it in the same category of mindless drivel like Seventh Heaven and Touched by a Whiny Irish Angel.",Music,Performance,
"Jerk off waiters, waitresses, and other restaurant staff spew sophomoric humor for people who've never seen foul-mouthed comedies (or get off on them). The running joke, herein, is something called ""The Penis Game"" - you trick co-workers into looking at your exposed genitals. Then, if they look at your worm, you shout ""fag!"" and playfully kick their ass. Note, the ""Unrated and Raw"" DVD shows squat.<br /><br />Stuff like spitting on food is about what you'd expect. The caricatures will be recognizable to anyone who has worked in a ""Shenaniganz"". The philosopher-dishwasher (Chi McBride as ""Bishop"") and tightly-wound waitress (Alanna Ubach as ""Naomi"") are made to order. Justin Long (as Dean) does all right with the best-written role.

"I saw this movie at the Toronto Filmfest and had such high hopes... soon to be dashed. The plot is both confused and boring, leaving the audience incapable of identifying with the characters. The backdrop of an erupting volcano tries to give the film tension but merely confuses the storyline. Harvey Keitel manages to make some of the movie at least watchable but this movie rated high on the numb-bum-omiter... for a movie pegged at 135 mins it felt like 4 hours.<br /><br />The whole audience was left in stunned silence at the end of the movie. When the Q and A started the director was asked ""what were the evil nuns about? "" he didn't seem to know what they were there for either... I'd like to think it was a nod to Monty Python ;-)",Plot,Others,
"I downloaded this movie because I had nothing better to do. I kind of expected to see a cool 'who-did-it' slasher flick; generic story, lots of gore, okay cinematography, etc. This movie was almost the exact opposite. The story was actually kind of interesting; a detective who's life was taken away is given a second chance due to a symbiotic parasite, but in exchange, must feed off human bodies to maintain both himself and the parasite. You could tell by watching the movie that the director tried to make it seem 'cool', by moving at a subtle, slow pace in order to deviate from a typical slasher flick. But he fails miserably. The movie is too dreadfully slow, the character development leaves much to be desired (which is almost a good thing sometimes...what was up with that Captain or General person who plays golf?). Also, some of the scenes were just plain weird. Near the end, when the female detective was sitting at the bench with the two guards in the towers, what went on there? Did she walk back to Johns house with a head wound, just in time for it to start bleeding? I found that to be a highly stupid sequence of events.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this movie was fairly bad; I know nothing about the director, but the level that this movie sits at makes me think it's possibly his first, and hopefully his last.<br /><br />I give this movie a 4/10.",Plot,Performance,
"Real life husband and wife duo Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne play famous married theater performers (named in the credits only as The Actor and The Actress). The Actor is so convinced that his wife would be unfaithful to him if given the chance, he dresses up like a Russian officer to try and seduce her. The Guardsman remains the only sound film that either Lunt or Fontanne ever did, which is a damn shame. Both actors achieve a natural quality on screen rarely equaled in thirties films. Lunt especially gives a knockout comedic performance, not only as the whining, conceited, jealous husband, but also as the brash and passionate Guardsman. The rest of the cast play their parts perfectly as well, doing justice to the delightfully witty script. It looses some momentum in the second half, as the film slowly works its way to the conclusion you know is coming. They definitely could have played with the scenario a bit more. Nonetheless, it makes for a very enjoyable comedy.",Directional Techniques,Plot,Others
"There is a recurring problem in the last two seasons of BtVS and I believe this episode highlights it better than most. One could see that the writers have had a decent or in some cases, great idea, for compelling drama but blatant plot holes and inexplicable turns in character motivation makes the suspension of disbelief completely go away, resulting in zero dramatic effect and yelling at the writers. The writers, not the characters. Yelling at characters for making in character mistakes makes for great drama. This does not.<br /><br />There is no way in hell Xander, Willow and Giles would completely turn against Buffy and basicalyl depose her just because they think her in a certain situation plan isn't sound. No way. No way. Her reluctance to kill Angel in season one leads to Jenny's death among others but later on Giles still trusts her judgment. Why would he not do that again? Especially considering they are in no way, shape or form safer from Caleb in the Summers house than they would be if they go for his lair and Giles and Scoobies don't have another plan at that point. It's painfully clear the main goal of the scene was to make Spike look for like an angel (not that Angel :)) in comparison. I haven't even seen the next episodes yet but this could hardly be more clear. I can see why the Scoobies were not thrilled by the plan but there is a world of difference between ""this plan is no good"" and ""Buffy, you are no good because your previous plan was the same and it failed"". Like their plans were successful every time before... And having a quarrel in front of all the scared Potentials? What were Giles, Willow and Xander thinking? Way to inspire lack of any confidence whatsoever. Remember Showtime where they planned it all in private? Remember the very previous episode where they trusted Buffy? One mistake and suddenly Faith is a better option? They behaved as if Buffy had known Caleb was so strong and led them there just for the fun of seeing people die. Yes, the plan was risky and they could have refused to go along but the dilemma presnted as ""the plan or Buffy, pick your poison"" is too contrived. She could have left, indignant by their behaviour, since she really some megalomania issues in the latter seasons. But all of the Scoobies deposing her and kicking her out of her bloody house due to a propositino they don't like? No. Just no. <br /><br />And the funny thing is, Buffy behaved just as silly as her friends. She repeats in this season over and over how she trusts Spike and Spike only. The plan WAS indeed quite suicidal and the gains from it merely hyphotetical at that point. A good leader should discuss their plan, all of it, not just the details. Yes, she should have had the final call but when have the Scoobies attacked the Big Bad without proper preparation and evaluation of the options? Remember how hard it was for Buffy to decide to not sacrifice dawn in Season 5? Now she has a gut feeling and expect people to follow immediately. WTF? She should be thankful she is still alive and wait for info from Spike and Andrew, not taunt the guy who gave them a thrashing on just a day ago.",Others,,
"If you want to see a little of the real Japan then watch this movie rather than ""Lost in Translation"" (which would have been better if it was filmed in New York so the director knew what she was talking about). Yes, it is a bit slow in some parts but anyone who has been on a self-finding journey will relate, and laugh even more at the funny situations they get into. Germans and Japanese have a lot in common so that makes the misunderstandings real rather than the usual ""foreigners in Japan trying to make the Japanese seem like savage aliens"". <br /><br />In this time of reality TV and home-movies being used on various TV shows, the hand-held camera shots are very real. Also interesting is that the characters names are the actors real names so it adds to the effect.",Plot,Performance,Directional Techniques
"This film was viewed by myself on TV about 20 years back, I caught it again one night, & it was more dull than bad quality. The main failure behind it is a stodgy script, which, in hands other than the original author, had much potential, it was as if the filmmakers had started out with the priority of getting the right cast & movie makers, and expecting the rest would fall into place. Many years ago, my daily paper ran a story, this was that the producers behind it created the film as a tax loss, and it never had been intended to be a financial success, but to save the producers, who are experienced and many fold, on their tax bill at year's end. That would certainly explain the dreadful script.<br /><br />An original New York Times Online film review hints clearly at the suspicion of the tax break allegation: quote: ""The Passage"" is so awful you must suspect it was designed to be someone's tax write-off. As such it should be a smashing success. and later on: ""In addition no less than six companies are involved in the film's production, ""presentation"" and release.'<br /><br />The film has minor compensations, the acting is not as bad as some reviewers allege, & it moves along fast enough to avoid the journey slowing one down too much. Not a good film in any respect however.",Plot,Others,
"If you can suspend your disbelief for a moment or so this movie will be even more enjoyable to watch. It is hilariously fun with just enough silliness not to interfere with the plot. Princess Esmeralda discovers an evil afoot while Don Juan comes through as the ever valiant swordsmaster with a quick wit and even faster sword. Miguel adds to the mix with his outlandish style of humor and well placed moments of timely exits. All of the action works itself well into the finale with the evil Krankenmal. Dakota, Jose and Douglas along with a great troupe of other cast deliver a fun filled, exciting performance that is reminiscent of the comedy and exploits known of them on stage in live performance. I would recommend this movie to anyone wishing to own a good comedy that is entertaining for the whole family.",Performance,Visual Effect,Directional Techniques
"I saw this in original release and recently viewed it again with a friend who'd never seen it. What I remembered about the film was obvious in seeing it again. This is the most bizarre performance Christopher Walken has ever given on screen. It's as though he personally finds the story insanely funny (and for many, Streiber's visitors in the night schtick is a joke), and he seems to be winking at the audience and barely restraining himself from rolling his eyes. Whether or not this movie works for you depends almost solely on whether you buy into Streiber's personal alien abduction mythology. I don't. Alien abduction may be an open question, but I see Streiber as an opportunistic huckster. So for me the film is third-rate sci fi. It's a little spooky in the beginning, but as it unfolds you'll understand why Walken seems to be laughing at a private joke all the way through the movie.",Plot,Performance,
"My brother and I have been watching and re-watching Twilight Zones since they first an live back in the early 60's. This episode has always been one of our favorites. ""the Big Tall Wish"" is a great tale of hopes and expectation wrapped subtly in the history of race. The scene in which the impressible kid who makes 'the BIG WISH' is quite memorable . . . ""Please, Please . . . ."". My brother and I would talk about when we would potentially need to make the BIG WISH. And then it happened. . . My brother Jeff, who lives in Los Angeles, had been in New York during the ALCS series. Being both ardent Red Sox fans for over 20 years at that point, we were really bummed by the way the Series was going. The night before he was leaving to go back to LA was almost the last straw. The Sox lost to go down 3-1. Jeff, who had tickets to the game the next day stated forlornly ""I'm going home to a funeral"". The game the next day was close but the Sox found themselves down by 3 entering the last at bat. Don Baylor hit a HR to bring them within 1 run. With 2 outs and a man on, Dave 'Hindu' Henderson came to the plate. The Angels countered with their top reliever, Donnie Moore. My brother, sitting in the left field bleachers and sensing the impact of the moment, closed his eyes and made 'THE BIG TALL WISH'. 'Hindu' promptly launched one into, of all places, the left field bleachers. Although the Angels tied it up, the Red Sox eventually won the game and went on to win the series. My brother called my right after the game hysterical and mumbled something about making 'THE BIG TALL WISH'. I knew immediately what had happened and how our mutual adoration with this series and, in particular, this episode had changed the course of history. at least from our distorted perspective.",Plot,Others,

"I just hate this movie. I'm a teenager myself and this movie disgusted me. For one, the main character in the film ,Georgia, was hideous looking. Oh my God i wanted to leave as soon as her face appeared. Now, now, before you go and reply back or whatever, hear me out, good god. Anyway, back to the movie itself. Her as a character is a completely different story. The way the characters put emphasis on their way of speaking made me just cringe, like i had to cover my ears it was so loud. The parenting was just disgusting. Like, in the end ""I'm going to take you to your first night club!"" as her mother said. WHAT THE HELL?! She's fourteen and SHES GOING TO A NIGHT CLUB?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That's just. OH my god. <br /><br />The story line is over used. Honestly, i think I'm actually going to read the books so i could get the REAL story and not some Hollywood trash they brought out. This movie was rated PG when i went to see it, it should be PG 13. Let me give you some examples<br /><br />""LETS GO BOY STALKING!"" ""Yeah, my mom could put a whole pencil case in her boobs."" ""Well YOU DID ask what it was like being felt up!"" ""OH my God, you're like, going 7 on the scale already?!""(which basically means sex in what i heard from the movie. I don't know)<br /><br />They put so much slang into their way of speaking, i should have brought a translator. Good Lord. <br /><br />I have so much more to say, but this movie's so bad, i don't think it's even worth it. <br /><br />I'd give it a ZERO, even a negative one if i could.<br /><br />This movie is worse than EPIC movie.

"One of the earliest Japanese animation films I can remember seeing, this film was a perfect introduction to me in how great a textured and visually appealing an anime story could be. Shot like a noir detective film with all the action and speed of a spy thriller, this film set a new benchmark for the sniper/hit-man genre. <br /><br />Duke Togo, while devoid of most emotion, captivates as a steely and ruthless assassin bent on survival as well as completion of his tasks. The stylish and dark film has conspiracies, presidential assassinations, serial killers, sex, guns, explosions and insane escape scenes. <br /><br />The story is straight forward; someone has paid Golgo 13 to assassinate the son of a wealthy business man and oil magnate. Revenge is to be taken on Golgo 13 at all costs, involving crooked cops, serial killers, generals, CIA, FBI, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Special Forces. Basically, Leonard Dawson is taking his son's death a bit hard and feels just a little raw toward Duke.<br /><br />The American translation is passable with pretty good over all emotional tone and great music setting for mood. One of my favorite anime and overall examples of noir style in graphic arts of the 80s if you can ignore that very dated helicopter scene that makes everyone so angry... Personally I didn't think it was bad, just out of place in a film with a perfect fever pitch already. Great ending, great film overall.

I remembered when this piece of crap premiered, I heard the good people of Nashville were mad as hell at the obvious insult to their city and state. So I went to see it just to see if they were over reacting. They weren't. Altman and his ilk, think all of us who live in the ""fly over"" states are a bunch of backward rubes who just don't get it, cause we vote republican. <br /><br />The casting was a joke, and the music worse. This was Hollywood country. This had nothing to do with Nashville or the country music culture. This was Country as seen through the eyes of the Hollywood culture. Why cast a bunch of yankees and west coast ""progressives"" to portray southerners, unless you're satirizing them. All I saw was a bunch of second rate actors dressed up as clowns, pokin fun at the backward hillbillies of Tennessee.<br /><br />Just as M*A*S*H was a jab at the military culture, Nashville was no more than a laugh at the country music culture of the South.

This may be the result of weak acting, a weak script, or both, but finding anything in this movie worth connecting to is very difficult. The characters stumble through a mediocre story that attempts to pull on the audience's heart strings but the whole fiasco just fizzles under the flaccid plot. Don't be fooled by the ""Indy"" reputation that this film attempts to hide under. It is not indy, it is just cheap. The divorced female version of campy sci-fi.
